  My boyfriend bought this for our house and our first thought on unpackaging was how tiny it was. Seriously, so small. Echo was easy to set up and worked perfectly the first time. Lots of cool voice features. No complaints there.But the microwave itself is terrible. We popped two bags of popcorn in a row one night and the microwave completely overheated, the little panel on the side lit on fire and has started to melt. It was only running for ~6 minutes total. I’m not sure if our model was defective or what, but having it less than a week and already broken is very disappointing.**update**Amazon has been calling and emailing me nonstop since I wrote this, even after I told them My boyfriend already returned it. They offered a free replacement or refund, which was nice of them, but I’m guessing they also wanted me to remove my review. Because I’m still getting calls. Even though amazon tried to fix the situation for me... this microwave was just bad.

  Although the Alexa integration seemed a little gimmicky at first, I quickly changed my mind after realizing how simple it was to use. Traditional microwaves have a million features, but honestly, do you even know how to use half of them? Gone are the days of pushing a button and looking at cryptic abbreviated text on the numerical LED screen, wondering what input it is expecting.The 0.7 cuft cooking volume is on the smaller side for microwaves, but its perfectly appropriate for a dinner plate or cup of coffee, and doesn't use a ton of counter space.And for those wary of Alexa turning the microwave on for 90 hours instead of playing music, I have found it has quite a few safeguards. First, it will only turn on for reasonable amounts of times (my attempt to microwave tea for 10 or 100 hours did not work). Second, it is aware of how long ago the door was opened. If it has been too long, it will let you know this and not start. This will prevent the microwave from turning on inadvertently with nothing in it.One of the novel features is the ability for the microwave to keep track of your popcorn supply and automatically reorders once you get low. The popcorn consists of large value packs, priced between twenty and thirty dollars. Not bad for 36 packs of popcorn....in case you happened to eat a lot of it.I was a little disappointed that when I asked the microwave for ""Tea. Earl Grey. Hot,"" she did not know how to do this. I am hoping this is just a minor oversight by their software engineers and will be patiently waiting for this update.

  A microwave is the most used kitchen appliance, or next to the refrigerator. Virtually every home has one. It is not something we shop for yearly, to replace, unless what we have is broken. However, could a voice control microwave be the new norm?First, here are the positives for this microwave. The price is unbeatable for a name brand product, an official Amazon brand, so you can trust it at least.  Secondly, despite the very low price, if you don’t want to use the voice control, you can still use it as a regular microwave.Nevertheless, as for now 2018, microwaves cannot produce a food, a snack or beverages themselves. You have to manually put your food in the microwave. So, my thought was, if I can put a leftover in the microwave to heat it up, why can’t I just press the buttons instead of using a voice command to warm my food? However, upon setting it up, I like the voice command more than pressing a couple of buttons.There is a catch to this though, the voice command is not built in the microwave, it only works with An Amazon Alexa echo dot. Upon receiving the microwave, you will connect it with your echo dot and command your echo dot to use the microwave as needed. It will acknowledge by repeating the command you gave and then start the microwave.Surprisingly, the voice command is more fluid to use even than using the buttons import we all are so used to.The downside is the Amazon echo dot is no Star Trek Enterprise computer that is smarter than the user. So, there are times you have to rephrase a command for it to work. For an example, I said to my echo dot, “start microwave for two minutes,” It had no idea what I was saying, but when I said, “microwave, for two minutes” it understood. I suppose, to use the command, after you call on your echo dot, you must follow by saying “microwave” then the command, warm soup . . . or reheat hot chocolate for two minutes etc.So, is it worth it? The answer is yes and no. If you spend a lot of time in your kitchen, you already have a microwave, likely one that is built into your kitchen, under the cupboard etc. Most people won’t replace their large microwave for a small microwave like the Amazon microwave simply because it has voice control. However, if you are moving into a new small home or you are a student, you might consider getting it. Or your current microwave is small, and you need a replacement without breaking the bank, you might consider it as well.The sound of the microwave isn’t loud, which is nice. Like most microwaves, there is a build in light when the microwave door is open and there is a digital clock on the microwave.

  This microwave is not powerful and heats food evenly.  Very low quality product.  It is cool that it is voice activated with Alexa, but you need a product that actually works, you can't just add voice to a crappy product.

  My mother has Macular Degeneration Disease.  This microwave is perfect for her.  Since it is voice controlled with short simple commands she has no problems cooking the food.  Being an ""echo"" owner, she is familiar with the voice commands. Prior to this type of microwave, she had many problems finding and pushing the correct buttons to prepare the food to the point that she wouldn't use the microwave.  The voice activation has returned some autonomy for her!

  I pre-ordered the microwave about a month ago. I received it on the release date and set it up the same day. I wasn't sure it was going to work at all since I watched the delivery driver (accidentally) drop the box as she stumbled at the top step of the van (and yes, I was concerned enough to ask her if she was ok; and she said she was).Setup was easy. It's a lot smaller than my other microwave and takes longer to cook food. Other than that, it does the job. I bought it, for the most part, as a novelty item/conversation piece. Now, if it would deliver the food when it's done, I would be impressed ;) I had to move my Echo Dot into the kitchen so I don't have to scream commands into the living room. I'll have to order a new Dot now.I tested the ""pop 2.5 oz popcorn"" command and found that I had to add a minute to the time as the first bag didn't pop all the way.  It reheated a dinner plate, defrosted 1 lb ground beef, and cooked oatmeal with no time adjustments. The popcorn replenishment program is a nice idea but I can get the same popcorn locally for about a third of the price for the same amount.When I unboxed the unit there was a plastic corner piece in the corner of the box. No one, so far, has asked what it's for; nothing is said about it in the any of the documentation either. I used it to set my Dot on in the kitchen. Once I get some double stick tape, I will be mounting it on the wall in the corner of my kitchen for the Dot.The biggest dinner plate it can handle (from my dinnerware) is the 10"" plate and I can use my cover on it.Someone seemed to have an issue about it wouldn't let them run the microwave from their Fire Stick remote. I'm assuming that their Fire Stick remote is a voice remote so I tested this using my Fire Stick voice remote (after muting my Echo and Dot devices) and was able to control the microwave with it.I would have attached photos but the upload photos function doesn't seem to be working at this time.

  Thumbs up Amazon!  Another amazing product!  Some people rolled their eyes at me when I shared my excitement about ordering the Alexa Microwave.  If you are the person who reads the directions on a frozen food box, throw the box in the garbage, only to dig said box out of the garbage a few minutes later to reread the directions on the box or if you microwave guess and stick your finger in the food to see if it’s hot enough, you will probably see the benefits of Alexa’s very helpful heating advice. She microwaved popcorn perfectly. I think I had only 5 unpopped kernels. Reheated one-half cup of coffee this morning to exactly the temperature I like it!  I’m not sorry I bought it. Saves space on the counter but big enough for a dinner plate.  No complicated set up. Worked with my Echo Show as soon as I plugged it in.

  Update April 2020....... So after all the problems I had with this microwave... It is now sparking.. I called customer service and they told me warranty ran out. Not only am I upset... My poor husband burned himself and my son is scared to death of this microwave when it's starts sparking. Who can afford to buy a new appliance now? This microwave should last longer than a year. I'm so upset I could cry... Please do not waste your money on this.I pre ordered this device. We are an Alexa  home and have been since its inception. So when our micro blew and I saw this microwave available I said why not?  Alexa and Amazon have never let me down.... Til now. I read thru the instructions as I always do for any purchase I make. I followed the instructions to the letter and still could not connect to my echo. Now the reason I gave this micro a chance is that my husband and I are both visually impaired so it's really nice to have voice activated devices. I called tech support and spent 40 mins speaking with Vogel who by the way was really patient helpful so thank u for that. But even he couldn't get it to work. Amazon you have let me down and I'm simply pissed and furious. Do better and be better! ******Update... It's been  a year and half and now it's sparking wth?

  When I told most people about this they wonder why don't you just press the buttons. Well it was for my dad who was legally blind and had all sorts of raised buttons on the last microwave so he could see what he was setting also he loved pop corn.  I can't tell you how well it worked for him because by the time of the announcement to the release he had died. However, I tried it and it works great. The reason for the low mark is it is so small it will not even hold a regular size dinner plate. The plate will not spin. I tried several of my patterns. Even my very small microwaves in college fit the size of a plate. That is definitely a flaw in the design that should be changed. If it was I would buy it again.

  Ok, so I preordered this and couldn't wait for it to come in.  I was very disappointed immediately on the unboxing.  This microwave  is tiny on both inside and outside.  I put a bluray disc in one picture for an example of the size.  They want you to order popcorn to use in this microwave.  Hmmm it must be snack size or of a specific special size.  First thing we did was put a bag in, first bag got stuck and tried to ignite.  See pictures.  Now, things I like, it keeps up with the clock, Alexa keeps that up for you.  Next is adding, removing time or stopping the microwave when you are in another room, tell Alexa and she does it.  Bottom line is, if you are living alone in a tiny space and only eat snack size bags of popcorn, this is your microwave, if not this is probably not going to be a good fit for most households.  The danger of an igniting bag of popcorn forced us to keep our other microwave and I don't need two in my kitchen so this one will likely end up in our camper.

  The microwave was super simple to set up.  It even set it owns clock.  The only problem is it will only work in the account it was bought under.  It won't work if it's in my wife's account even though pushing the Alexa button brings up the blue bar on the Echo Show.  So we have to be sure what account the device is on to use voice.  They really need to fix that issue.Lowering my review now one star because the light inside already burned out and there is no easy way to change it.  Don't feel like the hassle of returning it though.  It was just bought as a cheap secondary microwave.Edit:  The Amazon team reached out to me today and is fixing the issue.

  The microwave worked well until recently. We were popping some popcorn and microwave began to make strange noises and flashing after about 1 minute. The bag caught on fire as we opened the door. I grabbed the bag and quickly tossed it into the sink and doused it with water as our smoke alarm went off.We cleaned the microwave out, then tried heating a cup of water. No issue. We then tried another bag of popcorn and again the microwave began to make strange noises and flash after about 45 seconds. We stopped it before the bag caught on fire. Initially we thought there was something wrong with the popcorn bags and contacted the manufacturer of the popcorn. Last night I was heating up a couple of egg rolls on a paper plate and the flashing started up again after about 1 minute. I removed the egg rolls and they appeared normal, so I put them back and turned the microwave back on. Again the flashing and noises came. I unplugged the microwave and removed it from the kitchen.This is very dangerous as it is a fire hazard.

  First of all, this was perhaps the best setup experience to date.  I plugged the microwave in and 30 seconds later it was ready for commands through any Echo in the house.  No manual set up at all - it connected to my WiFi automatically and was pre-configured for my account.  I have come to expect this from an Echo device, but it was a bit shocking coming from a microwave.I received a notification on my phone for additional set up, including which Echo the ""ask Alexa"" button initiated and which popcorn to use for the auto-replenish (not mandatory).The microwave itself works like any other microwave.I love the compact size - my previous microwave stuck out over my very narrow Ikea shelf. This is the PERFECT size for the shallow depth Ivar shelving!As a brand new product, there are some command issues that I expect to get ironed out quickly.  For example, I pressed the ask Alexa button and said ""minute thirty"", which was interpreted simply as 1 minute and 0 seconds instead of the desired 1 minute and 30 seconds.  I expect slang and common parlance to function as expected over time.Overall, I have already found the addition of Alexa promising in making a very basic microwave a premium experience.

  Why would you not include documentation (i.e. a sticker) with the unit as to what the MAC address is?  If you connect to a network, you have a MAC, plain and simple.  I use MAC address filtering along with passphrase to get on to my network and because I don't know the MAC address of the microwave, it won't connect to my network.  I am not changing my entire infrastructure just because one manufacturer refuses to provide the documentation.  It is not listed ANYWHERE on the unit (which usually there's a sticker or imprint of the MAC of a network device near the serial number or model number) nor does it show up in the Alexa app when trying to connect it.  The Echo Dot and Plus show in the app when connecting them....I will change the rating on an update if this gets resolved.  Otherwise, it's being returned.[UPDATED 11/18/2018]Amazon Customer Service called me about my review, but NOT because of the review specifically.  They called because the review identified a bug in the development process before the product was released.  They have to update the Alexa software itself to identify the Microwave in the Alexa app, just like when setting up the Echo devices.  Stephanie, the rep, emailed me the MAC of my specific unit.  About an hour later, I had my network configured with the MAC filtering and it sync'd up fairly quickly.  I am now able to voice-activate my heating procedures.Now, just have to figure out how to create an Alexa-bot out of some Alexa devices and a Roomba and I will have my own personal maid!Upping to 5-stars, as the product now meets expectations and matches its description.

  This is a very nice microwave. Does all the things that you'd want a microwave to do, with the added benefit of having Alexa do all the work of programming. Another added benefit is having the clock know when the time changes twice a year. I've used this ""micro""wave for a bit over a week, and it checks all the boxes. One must note that it is what it is. This is not a 1000 watt machine.  This is not a 2cf oven. This is tiny, and it has 700 watts. Some things might take a bit longer. If you remember all of that, this is just about perfect for a one or two person household. (I did notice that Alexa was somewhat confused when the door wasn't completely shut (""I don't know what the problem is.""). This microwave replaced one that was larger and more powerful, but was ten years old, and had more buttons than I could use. I'm happy with my new one, thank you.

  This Amazon microwave replaces a .7 cu ft microwave. The dimensions are not what is listed on the product description making the cavity more of a .5 cu ft microwave, which is tiny.  The microwave I received is 17 (not 17.3) x 9.25 (not 14.1) x 11.75 (not 10.1).  I don't use the microwave very often so I'm hoping the benefit of having Alexa will outweigh the  small interior. If you're like me and always doing many things while in the kitchen, being able to put whatever item in the microwave, push one button and tell the microwave how long while I'm off to the next task is a nice time saver.  As is asking Alexa to add time or stop the microwave while I'm in the middle of that task.

  As far as microwaves go it's not bad. The Alexa feature, however, is not exactly what I expected. Instead of having as built in mic to listen for commands, it uses your echo device to listen.

  **Images from replacement**I wanted to love this. I really did. And I'll admit at first, I was in love with it. Then I realised there were little things I didn't like that turned into big problems. I'll first start with what I love about it.It's small and a perfect fit for my kitchen that has very little counter space. It is Alexa enabled so I can easily figure out how much time something needs or reheat something while I'm working at my desk or being lazy on the couch. I have problems with my vision at night so this is a huge help then. Or just when I have goop all over my hands. If you have kids this will be an amazing feature. Alexa sometimes comes back with she doesn't understand but most of the time it works and I guess they keep adding new commands. So that's a plus. It heats up relatively well. It's not magical but it works. Yup. That's really about it.Now to what I don't like. This tiny little devil is hot! And I don't mean that in a good way. I mean that in an ""it's going to burn your house down"", way. It literally gets hot! Not the inside but the outside. I cooked some rice in it, so it boiled water for ten minutes and when I went to get it out the top of the microwave was burning hot. The outside of a microwave should not get hot. That is a definite fire hazard. I tried popcorn twice the first time was magical and it cooked it to perfection. The second time it burnt the bag and I fear if I hadn't smelt it would have started a fire. Also, it has condensation GALORE! Not from the rice, obviously there would be condensation from that. I mean from cooking anything. Any time you cook anything in there entire inside gets covered in condensation. A ridiculous amount of condensation. No use in trying to wipe it out either there's so much. I tried just leaving the door open for a bit, but the bulb stays on and gets really hot. So I turn off the strip it's plugged into and leave the door open to try and air it out. It apparently didn't work because as I was packing the first one up to send it back it started leaking water all over me. I thought I dried it all out, but nope. It held onto water somewhere. That can't be good for the electrical parts.Customer service was great and they sent me a replacement but guess what? I have the same problem with the replacement. I don't know if it's because I ordered from the warehouse or if it's just a problem with the microwaves but this is a problem that Amazon needs to fix. This is dangerous. Condensation going in who knows where and the outside of this thing is hot as heck after 5 one minute intervals with thirty-second breaks in between. Not good Amazon. The use of Alexa is great but it's not worth the hassle or the risk. Once they fix these issues I'll be more than willing to give them another shot.

  This review is not for the size of the microwave or it’s connectivity to alexa. It’s a review of its functionality as a microwave.I’ve owned this microwave for over a year now. Although that’s a long time, the unit has barely been used. I’ve probably tried to use this more in the past couple months than the whole year prior. I’m not sure if it’s because normally I only use it for very short intervals and lately I’ve used it for minutes at a time but this thing has become a safety hazard.Lately, every time I use it, it starts sparking and arcing like crazy. It’s a very loud noise and a very heavy spark. It’s gotten to the point where it happens with each use and since I’m not trying to cause an electrical fire and burn down my house, it’s become too dangerous to use. I definitely can’t walk away from it because I have to unplug it once it starts doing it’s lightning storm thing. At the same time, I’m afraid to stand near it as the sound and visually as well, it appears like it’s going to blow up.There might be a repair that’s possible but I’m not an electrician and I don’t really have much time or patience to be doing skilled electrical repair on my home appliances. When I purchase an appliance I do so hoping it will give me at least a few years of normal use. I understand the industrial practice of “planned obsolescence” and that manufacturers want me to just dispose of items and purchase again but I don’t appreciate having a rarely used appliance function more as a safety hazard then a cooking tool.This microwave has less than a couple hours use. I keep it clean and I have it plugged in to a gfci plug. There’s no reason for this to malfunction like it is. I realize it’s not an expensive microwave and I realize appliances aren’t designed to last forever as thy were in the past but really Amazon? It can’t even last for a couple hours? I’m actually surprised because I’ve had good experiences with other amazon brand goods. From clothing to household products. But this is a huge safety issue.This microwave is too dangerous to use! It hurts a little to leave a negative review for an Amazon branded product but not only can I not recommend this microwave but I have to warn against it.

  I would say I loved this product until it almost burned my house down. We had a simple oven/microwave proof bowl with chicken in it. We have used this bowl multiple times with no issues. It started sparking and then flames shot out from the right side. Luckily we had nothing on top or next to it that was flammable or this could have been disastrous. Unfortunately I am outside my ""waranty period "" so I can't even contact Amazon to let them know about their own product that has a  major safety flaw. My entire house is Amazon/Alexa and this was the reason I bought this but it's not the same quality as other Amazon branded equipment. I wish they would back up the product if your name is on the front.

  We liked this microwave for 13 months, 2 weeks, and 4 days.Liked, because it isn't actually large enough for a bad of microwave popcorn and lots of things that fit in microwaves the same size seem to get stuck and can't turn in here. Still, it worked reasonably well for the price and wasn't annoying enough to send back.Yesterday, my daughter used it and it was fine. An hour later, I went to use it and sparks started shooting out of the little holes inside (top right corner).I turned it off and unplugged and frantically checked for misplaced metal, water, anything to explain. Nothing. Microwave looked normal and fine. Plugged it back in and tried again, this time sparks and smoke.Needless to say, it's past a year so I won't even bother contacting Amazon, but I'll also not risk even trying to turn it back on. Some people might think, ""Well, it was 50 bucks and you got a year out of it, whatever.""...but our last microwave was a free hand me down that worked for 5 years after we had it given to us, and was, upon research, 5-6 years old when we got it, and cost around $75 when it was purchased. Given the inflation rate, that microwave would've been around $92 when we bought this one in 2019... So 10-11 years of use for $92 versus a little over a year at $50.Based on that, and the fact that this product wasn't even amazing to start with, I can't recommend it to anyone else.

   Situation: Live in a small apartment with husband, two cats. We work opposite schedules so we rarely have time to cook large meals and/or have to eat on the go a lot due to our busy schedules (husband and I not the cats). When we do have have off we sometimes have a few friends come over for game night (the cats not us), but rarely have large groups over. There are two Dots and an Echo that we get tons of use out of and have fully integrated it into our lives.Need: A new microwave to replace the 30yr old one his parents gave us;  very large, loose door, barely worked half the time and was known to flip the breaker (YIKES!)Thoughts (Positive):-Perfect fit for our on the go and busy lifestyle.-If you're someone concerned with portion size (like us) I think this will be one of many solutions.-Couldn't believe how much power (700) this little guy had! We thought we would have to add additional minutes to cook certain items in as compared to our older machine (1100), but it cooked in the same amount of time.-Our kitchen Echo connected seamlessly with the microwave and was actually convenient to use when doing multiple things in the kitchen.-We have a VERY small kitchen with barely any counter space so I was very pleased with how compact it is.-Nice modern design with clean lines that will make up clean up fast and easy.-Still works without internetThoughts (Negative):-There is a learning curve with the Alexa commands. We found that giving Alexa simple commands like, ""Alexa, cook for 10min."" was by far the easiest way to use her instead. When we asked ""Alexa, cook popcorn"" or any other specific food item she asked the weight or volume and then wouldn't turn on the microwave. In my opinion it's just easier to tell her how long.-You will not be able to fit dinner plates or large tupperware in this appliance...safely.Who/What is this product for?The Amazon Basics Microwave is great for bachelors, bacehlorettes, college students, urban city dwellers, young couples, man caves, lady dens, harry potters cupboard, work shops, office kitchen, smart home enthusiasts, tiny home fans, garage, kitchenettes, millenials, tech savy baby boomers, doomsdayers etc.

To my shock it started making some crazy noise, sparking and totally smoking like it was about to catch fire in all of about 7 seconds! I opened it and it was all smoky smelling... piece of junk!I’ve never had a problem with a microwave, I’ve had them for years never a problem...

  Jan 26, 2020 EDIT:After I wrote the review below, I was contacted by Amazon. They offered a refund upon return of the microwave. I did send it back, and they promptly issued a refund.Ordered this microwave exactly 6 months and 3 days ago. Last night, it started sparking with just a small bowl of butter. Might be anomaly? Today, it produced MAJOR sparks heating up a plate with tortillas. Now, I can no longer use this microwave due to safety concerns. Amazon return period is passed, and 'product support' expired 3 days ago. Very disappointing. Unfortunately another casualty for the landfill. One would hope Amazon would have a bit more support for their in-house branded products.Considering my prior microwave lasted 13+ years, I would definitely NOT recommend this microwave because of the potential safety hazard and lack of support from Amazon.

  ive had this tiny cute thing for 9 months and had no problems with it.  Was thrilled with it actually.  Then against my better judgement decided i'd hook it up to alexa and be able to heat things up over the holiday without having to stand watch over the microwave while preparing other things. Adding the microwave was super easy and it picked up on commands well but about ten seconds in the first trial run with an EMPTY microwave set to one min i heard a funny sound.  Turned around to see the inside of the microwave was ON FIRE.  The nodule on the right side of the microwave seems to have melted and plastic microwave cover that i always use for splashes had melted and was in flames.  Tried to clean it off wipe it down unplug it wait a bit then try it again manually and it made the same shorting out sound.  So nine months and it looks like this microwave is no longer usable.  Im not sure about any manufacture warranty.  I did not purchase additional coverage because ive never had a problem with any amazon basic products until now.  The microwave also did not give me any trouble until i hooked it up to alexa.  If it wouldnt have caught on fire probably a 5 star little appliance but you know seeing how it could have KILLED me and my family im gonna have to give it a 1.

   I hate to write a bad review, but after 2 failed amazonbasic smart microwave I feel it's the right thing to do.  I brought this microwave 2 separate times on 1/9/19 and 10/20/19.  Both microwaves shared the same faith ended with the microwave smoking and sparkling while microwaving, which seems to be a fire hazard.  I am glad both times when it happened I was in the kitchen and stop the microwave before it goes further.  The first time I thought maybe its just my luck, but the second time I think it's a safety issues here esp on a brand new microwave thats only <1.5 years old.  I love the alexa feature (works 95% of the time), but they really need to work on the microwave part of the technology as its just dangerous.  I have contact the amazon customer service and asking them to report to their quality assurance dept b/c this is a fire hazard concern.  I will definitely not recommend this product.  Very disappointed with Amazon.

  Such a crappy microwave. It has absolutely no power. Something that I cook regularly at work just fine takes literally 4 times longer in this microwave and still doesn't fully cook. The alexa integration is cool, but not cool enough to make up for not being able to actually cook your food. If you are looking for a giant expensive way to reorder popcorn, this is perfect for you.

  TL;DR summary:Dies around the 1 year mark. Mine CAUGHT FIRE inside & continues to catch fire if used, after being owned 11 months. Non-Alexa set-up possible, but made purposefully challenging; really, REALLY NOT WORTH IT if all you're after is a small, affordable microwave.Longer version:I've seen other reviewers mention that their microwave starts to go after about a year - weird electric burning smells, etc. Well, mine is no different.I was heating up a piece of grilled chicken in a disposable, microwave-safe bowl (a brand I've used countless times before since childhood, I know it's safe). I set the timer for 30 seconds; it got to about 20 when I started hearing alarming pops and crackling. I could see flashes of light coming from the microwave. At first I panicked and thought maybe a piece of aluminum foil somehow got the microwave? Or I left a metal utensil in there, somehow?? I yanked open the door and nope, just my regular meal - except the side metal plate on the inside had caught fire, blackened, and bubbled. (See photos.) The side of my disposable bowl closest to the metal plate had also caught fire. Nothing was out of the ordinary; I had not done anything to cause a fire. An electrical fire just spontaneously happened. Now, I can't use the microwave AT ALL, because it starts to catch fire again whenever I try! After not even a year, I have a completely unusable microwave - that is, unless I want to burn my apartment building down. What a joke!I've seen some people say you can't use this without Alexa. That isn't true - I've been using mine without Alexa since I got it. (It's just not an intuitive set-up for non-Alexa use.) I didn't care about any of those features - I just wanted a small microwave for my tiny apartment. But understand you will get what you pay for. It is a cheaply-constructed microwave, not made to last. It wasn't even that fantastic when it DID work - usually took me twice as long to heat anything up. If directions said to heat something for 3 minutes, I knew I had to set it for 5. It was fine at the time because again, I just needed something small that worked... so much for that :(Personally, I'd recommend investing in a microwave that will last you longer than your apartment's lease. Sheesh.

  So I should've read the reviews before I bought it. I just opened it and hooked it up months after I bought it so I am sure I am not able to return it. First of all, it is small which isn't a huge problem but just be aware. The most problematic thing is we made popcorn and it caught on fire. There is a burn mark on the side panel then the other day I was heating up mashed potatoes and I saw a spark, sure enough there was a burn in the potatoes. Sucks having a microwave when you can make popcorn or have to worry about a fire. Especially when my son is only allowed to use the microwave when I'm not home

  It's cool to be able to talk to your microwave, but I was disappointed that my amazon tap wasn't compatible with the microwave, so I had to get a dot specifically for the kitchen. Something happened and now the microwave doesn't respond to alexa anymore. In regards to size, it is definitely small. It just about fit in the microwave compartment of the machine it replaced. My biggest complaint about the microwave has to do with making popcorn. A standard 3.75 or 4 oz bag of popcorn gets stuck halfway through popping due to the small size of the cooking chamber. Almost every time it gets stuck, the bag is resting against the grate that covers the microwave emmiter. When that happens, the bag starts to burn, and I have to stop the microwave in order to prevent a fire. So while it's a nice little microwave with a cool voice feature, I don't feel safe walking away from it due to the potential of it catching on fire.

  I purchased this microwave Dec 2, 2019.  It wasn't the best from the start.  It took a while to heat food, and I was never able to get Alexa to work.  However, this was a 2nd microwave, so it wasn't a big deal.Well, today this microwave just exploded in my house after not being used in days.  I had my 6 and 7 year go out in the back yard until I could get the situation under control.  My whole downstairs was so smokey I could barely see.  I live in California, and had to go outside where the air isn't that great (wildfires),  because it had better air quality than inside my house.  I almost lost a $600,000 home to a $30 microwave that I bought for it's Alexa function that never worked.I googled the Amazon microwave to find that I am not the only one this has happened to.  I am very disappointed.DO NOT BUY this microwave unless you want to risk losing everything you have.  I was lucky.

  So, first off, ignore the reviews of people complaining about the size or power. Clearly they did not look at the specs listed by Amazon for this unit. We specifically purchased it BECAUSE it was the listed size stated. Anyone with two brain cells will know that at 700 watts it won't have the power of a 1200 watt unit....Anyhow, we received our microwave and had no problems with getting it connected to our smart home system. Also we really loved the voice control that a connected microwave provides and had great success with it....that is until the stopped heating food AT ALL --- In less then a months time!!! I have had all sorts of microwaves in my 43 years and NEVER had one actually DIE........All the commands on the echo microwave still function, it lights up, it spins, - but the one thing that a microwave SHOULD DO is actually heat your food. ...SO back it goes, Amazon is sending a replacement unit..and hopefully this one doesn't crap out. If it lasts I will happily change & update my review.  But come on Amazon, its a 700 watt microwave- the last one we bought was a no name Walmart unit and it was just gross and old - but it still worked. How hard can it be it build?

  So far this has been a fun little Microwave Oven to have.  The family is learning the Alexa to Microwave voice commands.  One of the most important commands to use it ""Alexa STOP Microwave"".  You cannot say Alexa ""turn off"", ""off"", ""quit"" or ""cancel"" microwave.  I wouldn't waste my time pushing the Alexa button on the microwave if your trying to turn it off as the cancel/stop button is to the left of that button and your just wasting your breath.My wife originally did not want a ""Smart Home"" and now she is growing into the convenience of the system.  My favorite is the light controls and audio quality with the Echo Plus.  We have a Echo Dot in the kitchen to play music, set the timers and to control the microwave but honestly the Echo devices anywhere can do most of that and they are very sound sensitive.The microwave has a very efficient foot space and seems to be designed well.  So far as I know it is only available in the color black and it is the only size available within the Amazon Basics label.  This microwave was very affordable.  We got it for $41.00 shipped and the packaging was OUTSTANDING!  They even put a plastic three sided corner part to keep the weakest part of the box from splitting during shipping.  The box is so good that we can use it like a file storage box.  Its a heavy cardboard with side handles.The microwave's power seems to be just fine and with the help of Alexa the cooking times are accurate for each item. For example, you can say ""Alexa microwave a potato"" and she asks ""how many?"" and I say ""one"" and she replies ""microwaving one potato for six minutes and fifteen seconds"".  Easy Peezy.....The instruction manual is well explained and even better it comes with a small cheat sheet of commands and the other side has the setup instructions.You can watch a video on how simple the setup is and a basic demonstration on how the unit works.  There is a child lockout function simply by depressing the ""pause/stop"" button once and the ""0"" button twice.  The ""wifi"" indicator on the timer display will turn off and to reset that just repeat the process and it is back on.The power indicator is five little rectangle LEDS at the top of the clock area.  You can say ""Alexa Microwave Power 5 (or level 5) and she will ask ""For how long"" and I say ""one minute"" and she replies ""ok, Microwave Power 5 for 1 minute"".  Easy and it works great!The Alexa button on front means you can just push it and without mentioning her name just tell it what your cooking.The microwave does not have any fancy build in scale or volume measuring so its very ""basic"" ... pun intended.Now to get one in a .9 cu ft model / brushed nickel and I am very happy!  If this helped you please give me a tumbs up and have a great day!

  UPDATE (6/1/2019):  FAIL!  Whatever you do, it goes into ""kitchen timer"" mode:  counts down but does not hear or spin the turntable.  I had some difficulty convincing Amazon customer service that this was under warranty, and finally they did agree to shipping a replacement.Physically:  Note that the power cord is VERY thick and somewhat difficult to bend to fit the space.Software:  It works, but not very smart.  For example, why must I state quantity of popcorn in ounces rather than cups? Presumably this will get better over time.Support:  Mine was a first-day delivery, and support as yet to catch up.  In the Alexa app there is no place to select the microwave device in order to submit questions.  Several questions about the microwave which I did submit referring to the paired Echo have yet to be answered.Overall, it has promise but is half-baked at this point:  Alexa, improve the microwave app!Update:  The microwave does appear as a device on the iPhone app but not on the Alexa Internet web page yet.Update #2:  The turntable continues to be a problem, I think because the rotating spindle is so short.  Many circumstances cause it to lose positive contact with the glass turntable, which then stops.  Using the same containers, I never had this problem with the compact Sharp microwave it replaces -- wish I had it back!

  Upon delivery we received an email ""Lets Get Started"" how to install which I thought was great on Amazons part !Ours came with Wi-Fi simple setup enabled, so it was a breeze to setup.We started to use its voice command soon after and it works great every time.After about 12 minutes of not opening the door user can't activate any cooking commands until the door is reopen, for safety reasons I imagine.So I can't place a cup of water in the night before and tell Alexa, ""microwave 2 minutes"" in the morning at bed side, that ***** but safety first.Alexa responses, ""the microwave door has been inactive for to long"" and displays a letter ""d"" on it's control panel.Hoping for an update that will allow the user to press the Alexa key on the micro instead of having to reopen the door to reactivate the voice control.In that way after pressing the key it'll becomes active and it can be told, ""2 minutes"" and start to cook.If someone interested in buy more than one each Microwave needs a Echo to pair to but my Fire TV Cube was not listed, that ***** again. lolEach AmazonBasics Microwave will need to be renamed and given a unique name, I presume so it won't all startup.All Alexa devices including the Cube can control the micro by voice as long as they're all connected to the same WIFI network.It would be great to have an option for voice confirmation once the cooking is done, it just beeps for now.A full list of available presets to print out for quick reference, go to Quick-Cook Voice Presets (PDF).Hum .....  .. ... we may need to get another one for our den .....  happy Cooking !  :smile:

  I was in need of a small mircowave for the upstairs of the house, to do simple things like reheat a cup of coffee or tea, or other simple, low-load processes.  This compact microwave fit the bill, and the price was good.  So we got it.It did foit our small space well, and did it's job if it was a little underpowered (which I knew going in).  The Alexa integration leaves something to be desired, since you actually have to put something in it just before you start it - so if you're already there, why bother talking to an echo?But that wasn't the real problem.  After just over a month, my wife was reheating something and smelled something burning.  Low and behold, inside the microwave, there was a brownish burn in the area on the right side by a panel.  Glad we noticed it before a fire really started.It was over a month, so past the ""return"" window for Amazon.  I reached out to them for a refund (did not want a replacement that I would not trust).  It took some doing, but I finally got them to agree to a return and refund.Sent it in, and here is the really ""funny"" part.  Or maybe disturbing.Amazon reduced my return amount by approximately $10, charging me a ""Restocking Fee.""  Now Amazon KNEW that this device was being returned due to a malfunction.  And it should have been under warranty, being about 6 weeks old.  I have serious concerns with Amazon if they plan to ""restock"" this item on the shelves.  It is not about the money here - it's about safety, common sense, and treating customers right.  I could have gotten a replacement from them, but honestly, I would not use this device from Amazon EVER again.Be very careful if you get this item.

  I would highly recommend not purchasing this microwave. We have had ours for maybe a year and it caught fire!!!!! Like the reviewer said above I tried popping a bag of microwave popcorn and the next thing I know there are sparks and fire in my microwave. We noticed that it would arch when trying to melt chocolate for dipping purposes, thought it was a fluke.My husband has Motor Neuron Disease so he really likes this microwave because he has a hard time pushing buttons and our Alexa could set the time for him. Since our microwave caught fire last night I need a new one and decided to come read the reviews before I purchased a new one just like it (as when I purchased last year there weren't a whole lot of reviews because it was new).  After reading that it's not a fluke, but likely something with the line, I will not be repurchasing and I love Alexa based products. It's a shame because our kitchen is small and this microwave is perfect for our space and having Alexa for my husband has made things so much easier. Unfortunately, it's a fire hazard.

  I just received my new Alexa-enabled microwave oven. It works very well, just like an ordinary microwave oven, except that you can control it with Alexa. There are, however, a few limitations. First, you have to pair it with an Echo, since the microwave doesn't have a built-in microphone and speaker. Second, it is a small microwave oven, so Amazon does not recommend microwaving more than 3 oz of popcorn. (Unfortunately, most of the bags I had on hand were 3.2 or 3.3 ounces.)I had a little difficulty at first when I tried pairing it by pressing the number 2 for four seconds. It repeatedly responded with ""FAIL"" on the display. But, I was able to pair it after resetting it by pressing 7 and 9 simultaneously for four seconds.An added bonus: The microwave oven sets the time itself. Cool.As the guy who first used the term ""nuke"" as a synonym for ""cooking in a microwave oven"" in the early 1980s, I have to thank Amazon for training Alexa to understand this term.

  This has to be one of the worst items that I have ever purchased from Amazon.com! We had a microwave for several years that we used to make popcorn and reheat foods and coffee. It worked fine, but after several years of use it developed rust on the inside of microwave. I saw this one's price and the idea of using Alexa for the microwave was interesting. This microwave was very small on the inside. Even though it had a turntable, a dinner plate, large bag of popcorn or similar sized items did not fit at all. We decided to go ahead and keep it since we only used our old one to heat food and make the popcorn, we could just use smaller containers to make it work. The second issue we noticed was after each use there was a large amount of condensation on the inside of the microwave. After using it to heat a cup of coffee, there was an unbelievable amount of water up under the turntable.  The only good thing about it was its outside was nice looking with sleek features that my husband appreciated. However, I would not recommend this microwave to anyone for doing anything. The price paid and novelty of use with Alexa was outweighed by the negatives after the first day of use.  Don't waste your money on this one.

  It’s all very Gene Roddenberry. Talking to the appliances.Actually, it’s a fun option. Perfect size for a guest room.  Very easy setup/install. Just plug it in.

  first of all, I need to say that  I am not of the younger generation and not technologically savey, having said that I did not know that ALexa enabled meant that you had to have an echo thingy to make this thing be voice activated.  And guess what? Echo is not available on Amazon until 3/1/2019.  Also, apparently if you have a hick up in your wifi connection it wont work either, if it weren't such a job to pack this thing up and send it back, I would. All that aside, it does heat and it is small enough so it doesnt take up much counter space (there is a big difference between 1000 and 700 watts of power, add 1 minute longer cooking time if you are used to using 1000 ) I do feel that in the description of this thing Amazon should make clear that and Echo dot is necessary, so that the shopper can make an informed decision as to TOTAL cost of oven and echo!

  It was a fine microwave for a while.  I had seen stories about it catching fire and figured it was user error, or it was very rare.  Cooking a mac and cheese cup meal it just started smoking and burning, after only half of the proper time.  House still smells.  At least the counter top was able to be cleaned up.  Really, these are not safe to use.  Do not buy this.  I can't believe Amazon is still selling them.----Followup----I navigated eventually to get a CSR to call me, and an initial denial based on being > 12 months, I requested an escalation to a supervisor, and received a refund + small credit, despite it being 21 months.  To be clear I would never ask for a refund on a $60-70 microwave that quit working after 21 months, unless it stunk up our house for days , scared my children, and could have ended in tragedy if I was defrosting something frozen and had went to a distant area of the house or stepped outside.Furthermore, a safety/product report was taken by the supervisor, for what it is worth--though this is still for sale.  I replaced it with a $200 Panasonic model from Amazon :(, because, where else can I read reviews, even critical one like this?  It is a bit bigger, but I bet it will not burn our house down.  You probably cannot get a quality and safe microwave in this size and price for $60-70.  Honestly, Amazon should contract (would they pay or Panasonic pay?) with Panasonic to add Alexa and stop selling this POC ASAP.  I honestly expect a class action lawsuit notice by mail soon.  I bought this because Alexa on a microwave was a ""cute"" idea, and our old microwave was looking a bit dated, and was large in its location.  Prior to this experience I figured Amazon Basics was a mark of some minimal quality, but now I will avoid it.

  I thought this was a great microwave for a great price.... When I first used it, it smelled funny almost like burnt plastic..I thought maybe it was cause it was new... The smell eventually went away... Until.... IT STARTED SHOOTING SPARKS AND SMOKING!!! this happened 9 months after purchase. I wish I had seen the previous reviews about fire hazard! This product should be recalled before they have a lawsuit on their hands!! I have children that use this microwave frequently since their school in closed and I'm working.

  This may sound quirky but we enjoy having a microwave in arms reach of the dinner table (breakfast room) where a bowl or plate of food can quickly be reheated, and this new one replaced the one we once had before my son took it for his apartment.  Yes, the novelty of an alexa enabled microwave is an added bonus, but in reality this microwave is the right size for convenient placement for us.  So, as pictured, we have installed the microwave on a baker's rack nearby.  Set up was pretty easy, but a little confusing since I did not scroll down the alexa app's list of devices and instead did a search which yielded no results for the new microwave, plugged in and waiting.  Then after seeing the microwave listed it took unplugging and replugging to eventually get recognition. Then the microwave responded to alexa commands, even though I still had some trouble with the ask alexa button use.  It says that you enable the ask alexa button in the app, but I never found anything about that.  So the understanding of how things work was a little vague, yet everything seems to function correctly and we have put the device to good use the very first day.  It is nice having the microwave nearby again and for the price and features this microwave is a very nice addition.NEW NOTATIONI had not mentioned that the clock was an hour later, internet time set, than it should have been.  I assumed that my router was providing the wrong time (even though everything else had the correct time as set by the internet) and I just this past weekend got around to checking my router. It was correct and I have yet to figure out how to set the time correctly since it is automatic, alexa says it correctly when asked, and the instructions for the microwave say the user cannot change the time when wifi is utilized.  So I await some instruction on this minor detail.

  Amazon Basic Microwave oven model # S9N29R runs with Echo/Alexa arrived in two days and I've been using it for a day and a half. It was a little tricky connecting it to Echo/Alexa but probable bc I didn't use my smartphone (long story).  I used my. Amazon Fire10 to set it up...... It is amazing this technology. I was recently diagnosed with macular degeneration so this is a godsend.  I just tell Echo, ""microwave, 30 seconds for coffee -- microwave, defrost 1 pound of Hamburg... etc)....and she does it!  Now I don't have to run around to find my flashlight.... ..... The interior is a good size. Larger then I expected..  A regular 10 in dinner plate will fit.  And a 6 in tall mug/cup/glass also fits.  It has 700 watts which I almost decided against buying bc I wanted at least 900 watts.... Well, this microwave oven actually heats better and with less time then my old 900 watt oven. Believe me, you can't go wrong with this Amazon Basic Microwave oven. I love it. I love it..

  This microwave is less than a year old. We bought it last April and wanted something that would be easy to use and not a space hog. It is small, and definitely not a space hog. However, it doesn't always work the way you would like, which is typical sometimes of Alexa. She tends to be confused. (I don't hold it against her, I get confused sometimes too.)What really bothered me was we put a bag of popcorn in and it caught on fire. This is particularly dangerous. I'm glad someone noticed and didn't just wait for the timer to stop.I bought a second one as a Christmas present. Now I'm afraid that my son and his girlfriend will think I hate them if theirs catches on fire too!It's only convenient if it works and doesn't require a call to 911.Additional Note: Amazon contacted me to see about what happened and asked questions. They said they would get back to me regarding the product. Upon review, I found that I was not the only customer where the product caught on fire. Hopefully, they will fix this. They asked me to provide pictures of the burned food. Of course, I didn't save the flaming bag of popcorn or the ashes. Looking at the picture I think you can see that the problem comes from the plating cover burning out. I would assume, based on the flames that come out of it, there is an internal issue.  I'm currently looking for an alternate microwave, but I'm disappointed there are not more wifi options available. The wifi concept is genius. :(

  I'm seeing some mixed reviews off the bat, but after some research, I was able to overcome the setup problem.  It seems to all be related to where you initially set up your microwave.  If people put it in a nook or cranny, you will never be able to connect to it from the Alexa app.  I'm not sure how the connection process first works, but I only got it to work by moving it to my living room, surrounded by nothing, and plugging it in.  Once it connects to WiFi, it's good to go, and you can move it back to your kitchen or wherever you intend on keeping it.It seems like there's not a ton of pre-programmed stuff that you can ask Alexa to cook, but don't let that stop you from trying out this microwave.  It's more affordable than other 700W microwaves, and the voice activated feature is just an added bonus.  While it might be basic on button features, I think the Alexa feature has a ton of potential.The popcorn part feels a bit gimmicky; I'd rather it not keep track of my popcorn consumption and automatically order me more at certain intervals.  You don't have to set this up, but the Alexa app will ask you about it during the initial setup.  I decided to pass.It cooks well, it has simple packaging, and it works.  I couldn't ask for anything more.

  DO NOT BUY!I should've listened to the other reviews who said the microwave is not good but I have bought the cheapest model at Walmart before and it worked fine for a few years so I figured this would be an upgrade to that and would work for my needs. I was wrong.This worked okay for a few months but we had to throw it out. It started sparking very badly like someone put metal in (we didn't). Pretty disappointing to say the least. I would not recommend this microwave at all. The cheaper, no frills microwaves I've had in the past that got the job done and lasted longer without potentially setting my house on fire.The Alexa integration was okay, not super useful since pushing buttons isn't that hard but sometimes when I tried  new things like to tell it to soften butter, it wouldn't understand me.

  I can't rate the performance at all. I was looking for a simple low-cost counter-top microwave. The description says this one works with Alexa, but it doesn't say that it won't work WITHOUT Alexa. You cannot even set the clock without Alexa, and I had no intention of buying Alexa just to run what I foolishly expected to be a simple, basic, low-cost microwave. As a result, I returned it as soon as I realized what I had gotten. I'm sure this is a bargain for anyone already having Alexa set up, but not if you don't.

  I was looking for a microwave oven to replace the one we had and so had been looking at various models when this one started to be advertised for pre order. It looked like very good value for the money and had the added fun of being connected to the echo. I decided to give it a try and ordered one. It arrived on the day it was available.  It was well packed and in perfect condition. It took me only a few minutes to set up. Operation is easy. I decided not to utilize the popcorn ordering feature as the popcorn was ridiculously expensive but I will keep checking to see if the prices of Amazon popcorn go down. I recommend this to anyone looking for a smallish microwave.  Even without the Alexa feature it is excellent value for money.

  A microwave really has one job: heat food. This one is bad at it. The first one we got died within months of getting it. The second one is still technically working, but we hate it. It takes forever to heat food yet somehow it heats the plate or bowl MUCH faster than the food inside of it. So it is quite common to burn your hands while taking things out of the microwave, yet you need to put it back in because the food is still cold. This wasn't the case with our last microwave and that is the only thing that changed. The mechanism that rotates the plate around tends to make a clunky sound like it has gotten off its track, but no. That's just how it sounds. It is not pleasant to listen to while you wait unusually the long time for your food to heat up.The bells and whistles of this one seemed cool when we first bought it. Ooh, we can integrate it into Alexa and tell it how long to heat! Well, it was entertaining with the first one but we didn't even bother integrating it with the second one. It just isn't worth it. I have a feeling it won't be around long, so why bother?

  Update after 1.5 years of use:  It's still cheap and efficacious; more update at the bottom. (4 star rating unchanged)To be clear, this is one of the cheapest microwaves (when on sale) you'll find in this size/wattage and appears to be sufficiently durable and efficacious in that role.  It has some buttons that do some things, just like with every other microwave.The Alexa stuff, though... Proprietary popcorn purchases? Piffle.  Also, I'm not sure why a microwave needs geo-location tracking.  Also, if speakers for Alexa are overkill, it should at least have a microphone so I don't have to yell across the house.  Knocked a star off for annoyance.I've seen complaints here about it being too small for a dinner plate or a bag of popcorn; I'm not sure how big of a dinner plate they're using, nor what size popcorn bag, but I suspect there is something odd about their dishes rather than the microwave being too small.  It is as big as it says, and not as small as people say.Rest of the 1.5 year update: The spinning glass plate developed a hairline fracture that finally shattered the plate today; these things happen and fortunately I had the old plate I kept from my previous microwave of 7 years.  It's a minor and not unreasonable issue; I'm still content with the purchase.  I still maintain Alexa integration is pointless; perhaps someone wants to ask their microwave to spend money on popcorn, but that person is not me.

  I temporarily live in a one bedroom apartment with a small galley style kitchen. A benefit of this microwave is it does not overwhelm my limited counter space. Unfortunately (and logically) it is small inside and out. Can't get a full size dinner plate inside. But it does work for smaller plates. Probably the 5th microwave I have owned over the years and the only one that I noticed a ""sweating"" problem inside. You get done with cooking/warming up the food and there is noticeable moisture all over the inside. It's like it needs an exhaust fan. Not sure if it has one, but if so, it does not work. The Alexa feature is interesting. I do use it, mainly because I do not find the start button very easy to push. It is black and does not stick out from the rest of the panel. Often I am half an inch off either way when trying to push it. Of course I generally do not stare right at the button while pushing, that might help to center things. But typically (with most microwaves) just feel for the indent or see the outline and push there. I would not buy it again, but not unhappy that I bought it.

  I've had this microwave a little over 2 years. Its tiny. However, it still needs to vent, so must have space at least on the left side.I believe the reviewer that said hers melted the bag or set on fire. Normal popcorn bags are too big and get stuck. I keep watch and move them, but the panel does get overheated. Your food, however, will never be overheated. It will take an eternity, or at least double the time of another brand.The only useful aspect of integrating Alexa is that I can whisper into my phone ""microwave 2 minutes"" and the microwave beeps LOUDLY, but only once. You still have to be there to put the item in. If you leave a mom coffee in there for an hour after its 3rd nuke, you still have to come to the microwave and open and shut the door. The microwave also forgets that theres coffee inside it. I get it. Today, while cleaning around the center piece with wet paper towel, I felt a crunch. The paint has bubbled up in the center and is cracking and peeling. I dont have many spills and use dish soap to clean it.I wouldn't purchase this microwave again. I would recommend it only because of the price. I got it on prime day, so it was a much better deal and actually worth what I paid.

  My wife wanted a small microwave so I order one of the first of this model with alexa.  I plugged it in tonight and it sent smoothly on my lan.  I have an alexa echo and have one smart plug.  Almost immediately after plugging in the oven was connected with the proper time showing.  Wanted to pop popcorn.  Read that max was 3.0 ounces.  The directions say not to exceed 3.0 ounces as the bag may expand and catch fire.  Well all the bags I had in the house were Orville 3.2 ounce bags..  I put bag in and ask Alexa to pop 3.0 ounces of popcorn.  You have to tell it how many ounces you plan to pop.  I thought if I say only 3.0 it would stop before burning.  I was wrong.  Although popping slowed down for 20 seconds before it stopped.  When I removed the bag it was charred on one corner and some of the corn had burn spots.  So seems a bit of a design flaw to make microwave that will not hold a most common microwave size 3.28 ounces.  Yes directions clearly warn, but could it not have been of the size to accommodate this common size.  Now to use I  will have to search for bags with 3 or fewer ounces.  That is the reason for my 2 stars

  Was excited for this device and the price point so I couldn't wait for the pre-order to get in. And then things went downhill fast.Problems:This microwave is tiny. Terrible for a household. Maybe good for a college student or your kid that needed a modern easy bake oven. I cannot fit a normal plate in this device.You need to purchase a separate echo device to connect the ""Alexa Enabled"" device to your account in order to use voice commands.Setup Instructions are infuriating. And considering every other Amazon device I buy comes pre-setup with my account information ready to go, this just added insult to injury.What I like:It can heat up left overs, even if its only 2 slices of pizza at a time.

  First of all, I'm usually a fan of Amazon's products, and use many Alexa devices in my house.  I at first couldn't pair this device with my Alexa, and when I finally did (or at least it reported that it did), I still can't use the voice features.  I've had it three months, and have never once managed to activate it by voice.Next problem, it's too small for anything.  I can't get a dinner plate in it, even my side plates (they're square) won't rotate in it.  A microwave dinner (or even popcorn, that it supposedly has special features for!) won't fit at all.And the last straw - it doesn't actually HEAT anything!  I had a meatball dinner tonight, supposed to take 3 minutes on high.  After three minutes, it was still cold.  After another three, the first one I picked was warm, and I was hungry, so I sat down with it, but most of the rest were still cold!This is a total failure of a product.  Its special gimmickery doesn't work at all, it isn't sized to be useful at all, and its basic features don't even function.HARD PASS!

  As others mentioned, I thought the Alexa feature would be gimmicky.  But I wanted to try it anyway just for fun.  Turns out - it really isn't all the gimmicky!  I LOVE the Alexa feature.  I love that it takes the guesswork out of how much time it takes to cook or reheat something.  I just tell the microwave what's in there and voila - it cooks it!Downsides?  It's smaller than I would want.  I have a family of 5, so I hope they come out with a larger model.  I also wish you could program various commands.  For example, I can tell it to cook hot dogs, but I can't tell it to cook corn dogs.  Sure, I can get by with the ""hot dog"" command, but it really needs a slightly different time for frozen corn dogs.  I hope to see some customization available in the future for specific customer favorites.I have particularly enjoyed the following commands: ""reheat 1 cup of coffee"", ""cook 1 (or 2 or 3) hot dogs"", ""cook 2 oz of popcorn"", and ""reheat 1 dinner plate"".If this microwave were bigger and had the ability to customize voice commands, it would easily be 5 stars.  This microwave size is probably perfect for smaller families.  It still works well for mine for now.  But as soon as I see a bigger model. I'm upgrading.

  It *does not* have an embedded microphone, and requires the paired Echo's microphone to register your voice commands.So, if the paired Echo is not near enough to the microwave... You will push its ""Ask Alexa"" button on the microwave and yell over your shoulder, ""reheat one cup of coffee"". Alexa will respond by telling you the population of the Tibetan plateau, asking you how many rolls of toilet paper you want to add to your shopping list, or otherwise infuriating you because she didn't understand you. You will try and fail 2 more times to tell Alexa to warm the coffee, then use your fingers to carry out the task lest she play a Snoop Dogg song for your kids in the den or call your ex boss.The Amazon listing pictures all display the microwave installed near an Echo device. Before purchasing, I did happen to notice this, and assumed it to be marketing product placement by Amazon (ie, let's show non-Alexa households who view this listing how ubiquitous Echos are). I now understand that Amazon was attempting to convey that it does in fact work ""with an Echo device"" THAT IS NEAR THE MICROWAVE.If one plans to use it near an Echo device (and/or otherwise live in alone), this ""echo proximity"" problem is likely a non-issue. For my use case, it is a total fail since I was not planning on installing it directly nearby one of my 8 household echos, and my housemates make their fair share of vocal noise during kitchen mealtime. I think it is worth a 2 star dock since, after all, this is Amazon's microwave that, without further qualification, ""works with Alexa"".Like most people, I am accustomed to larger/stronger microwaves and therefore I was prepared to be underwhelmed by the microwave's performance.  It heats foods very slowly, and you can't fit much in it. That said, the dimensions are shown on the website and it is only 700 watts, so I don't think it is fair to dock stars for its performance or size.I am sending it back. I suppose the Echo proximity problem wouldn't be a dealbreaker for me if it was a bigger, stronger unit...but there's that...FWIW, I had the microwave about 5 feet away from the Echo.

  I'm nearly 80 and recently moved into senior housing, downsizing to a 500 sf apartment. Had to get rid of a lot of big items including my giant microwave,  and was despairing of ever having another until Amazon came up with this little cutie. It's tucked into the corner by the stove and small enough that there's still 10"" of counterspace.Having read many of the reviews, I was worried that I'd have trouble getting it to connect with the Dot, and it failed to connect the first two tries, but I took the advice of one reviewer who said to unplug and replug the Dot and the microwave, and when I tried that, it connected within two minutes. Very easy, and I'm no techie geek!It's small, but perfectly adequate for heating anything that will fit on a 10"" Corelle dinner plate.  The turntable is rather thin glass but so far, so good. It does stay in place perfectly well, and I have to wonder about some of the negative reviews. I'll hold onto the shipping materials until I've had it longer, but so far, it seems perfect.As anyone with bifocals knows, it can be really hard to read small print at countertop level, so I'm very happy to have voice command. It works without a hitch. I highly recommend giving this dandy unit a try!

  This is the worst microwave ever. It worked fine but it recently started catching fire when I use it. The panel on the inside would spark and start a fire. When I called Amazon they said that they did not make replacement parts (obv so you have to buy a new one) and that they couldn't even get me a new microwave because it was past the return date. In short, Amazon only guarantees that this microwave works for 30 days. My experience with trying to get this microwave replaced honestly makes me want to stop using amazon. This is still an expensive appliance and it is unacceptable that I have to pay the price for amazon failing to produce a working product.

   I know...It's just a microwave. But it's an ALEXA powered microwave. That just increases the cool tech factor by 200 %!! Seriously, this addition to the Echo/Alexa family is very welcome. It's small, but that was expected based on the specs listed in the ad. No surprise there. For the small wattage, it does a good job heating up food and COFFEE!😁 I like how Amazon added the Alexa button, just to make the experience even more gratifying. Check out the video for more details and a set up tutorial. It's VERY EASY to set up. If you're like me, the microwave clock is THE official house clock. The time will always be accurate, since it is configured based on your wireless network! Love it. I also appreciate that Amazon made this a part of their monthly payment program! That makes it easier to pick one up and pay in 5 monthly installments!

  A lot of people see this as a gimmick and they’re not necessarily wrong but it does have some value. For me, I bought it when my dad was still alive and living with us and he had difficulties seeing. He could move around on his own, but just couldn’t see buttons too well.So I bought this with the hope that, well, he could at least make himself a cup of a water and put it in and then tell Alexa how long he wants the microwave to go so that he could get a cup of hot water for his morning tea. Gave him a sense of independence again and a little hope he could continue through life despite this awful disability that caused him to feel depressed and helpless.I kept the microwave even after he passed away and continue to use it. It’s mostly a fun thing to show off to friends and family coming by to visit. The real use I like about Alexa is that I’ve never liked standing in front of microwaves. Probably more paranoia than reality, but whatever. Felt good to be able to put food in the microwave, close the door, and then step away and tell Alexa how long I want it on for instead of standing in front of it as it went off.There does seem to be a safety feature built-in where Alexa will not turn on the microwave if the door hasn’t been opened recently, to prevent accidental activations, which is good.I’ve heard of these things being a fire hazard, but I’ve had mine for over 3 years now and it still works as it does out of the box. It’s been nice moving into a smaller home to have this smaller microwave that doesn’t take up a lot of space.BUT the worst thing about this is that it really is not powerful enough against any other microwave I’ve come across.I warmed up a frozen breakfast sandwich this morning. The defrost worked as it should at 30 seconds just like the package ordered. But running it at the recommended 65 seconds didn’t work. Doing an additional 30 seconds still left the inner egg and sausage ice cold. Like, no, literally. Could have put those in a glass of water to use as ice and it would work. The outside was lukewarm though.Had to put it on for an additional 45 seconds with the buns off for it to finally warm it.So despite it still running and everything…I’m switching to another microwave that can actually work for me. It’s just not enough and it’s been this way for a long time but I’ve put up with it until now. I need something more powerful.

  We purchased this microwave in order to have something convenient to use during a kitchen rehab. We knew it would be ""basic."" We thought we might keep it past the rehab, because we would have a really good oven and might not need a microwave much for anything other than reheating or heating frozen dinners. We didn't make it to rehab completion!  It has in recent months seemed to have erratic heating -- sometimes 2 minute oatmeal would be lukewarm, sometimes really hot. A few months ago, when microwaving 2 potatoes, it got really hot and set the fabric ""potato microwaver"" on fire. Lots of smoke, but no apparent damage to the microwave. But tonight, with one potato set to cook for 3 minutes, with holes punctured as required, it again started a small fire. I removed the fabric cover and tried microwaving the potato, which despite 3 minutes was not even hot, for a minute. First it sparked a few times, then fire shot out from the side and completely covered the side heating element with black carbon that cannot be removed! This sounds like what another reviewer had happen. Be careful with this microwave. And when it becomes unreliable, that's a sign of upcoming danger.

  I’ve had this microwave about 6 months. My amazing 10 yr old Magic Chef microwave sadly bit the dust right after quarantine started. I bought this one only b/c it was the only one I could get in less than a month. It works ok BUT every time after I literally use it for less than 3 minutes, the top right side of the microwave gets EXTREMELY hot. Like almost burn your hand hot. If I use it longer, the top keeps getting hotter and hotter. Not only this, but if I leave it plugged in, the outlet plug also gets extremely hot as well. I no longer leave this plugged in and ONLY plug it in when I need to use it. This microwave overall makes me very very uncomfortable and I’m definitely afraid that it could overheat easily of left plugged in or used for more than 10 minutes at a time. Besides that, it’s also very small and short. Much smaller than I was expecting. So, essentially: it does the job but buy at your own risk and don’t buy if you do a LOT of microwaving. And don’t leave it plugged in!!!!  I would not purchase this again or recommend it.

  Microwave works great.  A little on the smaller side.  That said I was expecting my children to be able to press the button and say warm up soup and Alexa would know how long to warm it up.  She does not know how long to warm so she ask which is fine but defeats the purpose since my 5 1/2 year old can not read the directions on the soup can.  Perhaps Alexa will learn this information as we keep using.  Other than that I think it was a great buy at a very good price.

  I hoped to enjoy this microwave and the slight convenience of using my Echo to run it.  It seems like a good microwave, if a bit small, but I didn't really get to use it.Why?  Because I have five kids, and upon setting it up, I found out there is no good way to keep your kids from starting the microwave with their voices.  Since Alexa isn't 100% accurate, it it entirely possible someone could accidentally (or as a joke) start the microwave just by talking when there is nothing inside it.  This is a very real fire hazard, and without a workaround, I had to return the microwave.There IS a child-lock feature, but it involves pressing a button sequence on the microwave that turns off voice commands.  Since you have to do this every time you want to activate or deactivate voice commands, it defeats the whole purpose of voice integration.If you have kids, be aware before purchasing this microwave.

  update:  got a replacement and it's working fine for now.  but every time i put in food or remove food, the turntable slips and i have to try to get the ring with wheels to stay in place while i settle the glass plate onto the cog that turns it.  of course, this happens from time to time with all microwaves... but on this one, it's a constant problem.  looking forward to the day when i can replace this with a better quality microwave.--------------  i am used to compact / lower powered microwaves so no problm with those aspects of this product.  while i was super excited to have an alexa integrated product, it seems to unpair a lot...which is super lame when i’m in the thick of cooking dinner and now have to deal with this.  but the biggest problem for me is that the interior light no longer works after just a bit over of month of use.  not sure if this is a bad lightbulb or faulty wiring - don’t want a fire like another reviewer mentioned!  so now i have to figure out how to return this thing during a shelter-in-place which is incredibly inconvenient.  i am probably going to replace it with the same and hope for the best since the whole reason i bought my echo dot is to use it with this darn thing.

  I bought this microwave, set it up and tried it with Alexa. It worked a couple of times. Decided to move it to my kitchen, never worked again with Alexa. I tried everything many times:1) Plugged-unplugged Microwave2) Removed the device (from the very first time) and tried to re-add it with no luck.3) Restarted Alexa app4) Tried to add over and overAll I get is a ""FAIL"" in the LED of the device.In the troubleshooting, there is no mention of a ""FAIL"" message. It seems to me, that should be in there as it is an obvious problem. Don't bother looking online. There are lots of mentions of this issue by others but no solutions.This product obviously has not been tested thoroughly. I knew this was likely a flimsy microwave due to the price. I just figured a little Alexa integration would make up for it. So if you are just looking for a junk microwave for the garage or something, this one probably would work for you.It's probably wise not to put too much faith in any Amazon Basics product with the ""works with Alexa"" gimmick. It's just a way to get you to buy substandard electronics with the lure (assumption) it will work with Alexa.

  I bought this little ( very small) microwave out of necessity when I had renters at my home in late august and my microwave died. ( or renters killed it). It arrived in two days and my renters were very happy. I didn’t see till after my renters left.First impression was how small it was and secondly I had no idea the Amazon basis brand micro who be controlled by “Alexa”. I am a big fan of all Alexa devices and a gadget guy so I thought this was cool.You can’t heat up anything of real size but it’s great for small plates and what I mostly use it for is coffee and tea to reheat. It’s very convenient when you can put your coffee in and say “ Alexa microwave for one minute and it turns itself on.Just the other day the microwave stop integrating ( is that the word?) with my Alexa and I am no longer able to speak to it or use the Alexa button on the front of the microwave.I am very disappointed as it’s not even 3 months old yet and already breaking down. I didn’t pay a lot of money for this microwave but you would think I would at least get a year out of it.So buyers beware of this product and as old joe says “ come on man”

  Edited on 10/7/2019Okay, I'm changing my reviews to one star. This is an absolute DO NOT BUY. We bought this microwave in January, and you can see my opinion on it from my review below which I will not erase. This product is just shoddy. The lights on the clock have started to fade, the Alexa integration has complete stopped, and the last straw is that tonight the damn thing caught on fire. Yep, literal flames shooting out the side (into the inside of the microwave). We unplugged it and will happily toss it in a dumpster tomorrow. This is just plain not worth your money in any regard._____________________We needed a new microwave, and let's be honest, I bought this because it was cheap and amusing.This microwave is SMALL--picture a small microwave, and this is probably a little smaller than what you're picturing. If I take the lid off a venti starbucks coffee I can just barely, by tipping it to get in, fit it in to stand up inside the microwave. The turntable is smaller than my regular size dinner plates (but they do just barely fit inside). I don't recommend this as your main kitchen microwave unless you, like us, need a lightweight and small one to fit (apartment kitchen, I needed something small).The Alexa integration isn't perfect--sometimes if I ask Alexa to stop the microwave she does it, and other times she tells me it's not supported. I haven't tried a lot of commands like ""reheat coffee"" because I'm usually standing there and just push the buttons, but I have used it once in awhile and it's fun. Otherwise this microwave is basic. No major plusses, no major cons. Can't speak to longevity or ease of cleaning yet as I haven't needed to scrub it.

  So far so good, only issue I have is using Alexa. I assumed it had a mic built in, it does not.  It just does not catch my voice all the time and I have to stop and move closer to my Echo located in the other room or pull up Alexa app on my phone and ask Alexa to microwave. Cubic space is on the smaller side but perfect for my household. For the price it is on target for microwaves out there. It really needs a built in mic, I have 1 echo in my living room, I feel like I need another Alexa enabled speaker/mic product to put in my kitchen just so I can have the microwave consistently hear my commands. I ultimately do not have Alexa going on my phone constantly to save my battery, so it's one more thing I have to do in my kitchen or I need to move my Echo to my kitchen.

  I purchased this microwave back in January of this year, was slightly disappointed with the alexa capabilities it had...or lack there of. The size of the microwave was actually pretty great. Its quite small and didn't take up much counter space. The microwave worked well as a basic microwave for about 6 months. That was when we started to notice a subtle scent of burning plastic occasionally when it was used. We truly don't use our microwave very often so it wasn't until about 3 months later when heating up a cup of coffee in a microwave safe cup that i heard loud zapping noises and ran into the kitchen to find that there were sparks and smoke coming from the microwave. Obviously I instantly unplugged it. The culprit was a metal component on the right inside of the microwave. Ill be the first to admit user error when the shoe fits but in this case it was 100 percent a manufacture issues of some sort. An extremely dangerous one at that. So please take my warning and avoid purchasing this product. In theory it sounds like an awesome microwave, but it doesn't deliver anything but being conducive to a house fire.

  We received this as a gift about a year and a half ago, easy to set up with Alexa and worked fine although a little weak for a microwave. It didn't get heavy use, just a few times a week. But last week it started to spark inside while re-heating a plate of food which was strange as the plate had no metal. I cleaned the inside to be on the safe side (although it was clean already), didn't spark after that but a week later while heating a cup of tea it went off like fireworks, sparking, flashing and making a crazy buzzing sound. I pulled the plug and looked inside to see and smell smoke, with the reflecting plate inside the microwave showing a singed mark. I checked the reviews for this microwave and see this is a recurring problem for those who have had it a couple years, an extremely dangerous hazard. I've had numerous microwaves over the years and never seen this kind of issue. Amazon needs to get this microwave recalled pronto before there's more damage done...

  We've had this microwave for less than two years and it is a troublesome microwave. It is underpowered, so frozen foods do not always cook evenly. For soups that say 3 minutes, we have to heat them for 3 minutes 45 seconds. It's annoying. Our microwave-safe bowls and dinner plates are either too large or too heavy, so you have to tilt them to put them in the microwave.We often have to unplug it and plug it back in to get it to work. This week, my wife was making popcorn after I had heated some ramen and we smelled something ""off"". I opened it up and guess what?The darn thing was burning. There is a little panel on the side of the interior (see picture) that has filled with 'food gunk'. Turns out, that 'gunk' catches on fire. Before you get judgmental, understand that this thing is not easy to clean. It is very small. traditional cleaners don't seem to work, so I tried the lemon juice and water trick on it. Still no cleaner.I also feel I shouldn't have to remove a panel on the interior of a microwave to clean it. I really don't want a microwave that I have to break out hand tools to clean, that's ridiculous. I want to heat a bowl of water and wipe the inside with a paper towel. This one is not fun to clean.Alexa did not work on this microwave for months. Then, when we got the Echo Show? It worked. It's convenient, but not great. The buttons on the front don't light up, so when you are watching a movie, it is nice to say, ""Alexa, microwave for three minutes"", but we eventually just used our phones like makeshift flashlights to see the buttons.As I said, we sometimes have to unplug it and plug it back in to get the buttons on it to work. Not exactly what I paid for and I'm not thrilled. It's heading to the dump in the morning since I read an article in the paper about some amazon products catching fire. At first, I laughed since we have several echos and assorted USB cables throughout the house.What really grinds my gears about this, is that I not only need to buy a new microwave in the middle of a pandemic, but I was never once contacted by Amazon about the issue with this or any other product having issues like this one has.I buy quite frequently from Amazon. I wish they at least had the option to return the product, but there is no option on the site. All I can do is let you know my experience and warn you away from this product.

  I was concerned that this micowave might not work like all the other microwaves I have owned.  In the info/description focus was put on the wifi features and I could care less about those features. It is a affordable little microwave that works fine as just a regular microwave. The best thing is that I put a 8x8 square glass cassarole dish inside and it actually turned and warmed. I was surprised it fit and rotated in such a small microwave. I was looking for a small microwave that does not take up a lot of counter space and was affordable. If I could redesign this unit and still get this price, I would skip the wifi stuff, I do not see any value in speaking to a microwave. I would love a microwave that put the controls on top. Making the unit take up less counter space. Go vertical! Why is it whose who design products think we all want wifi. I want functionality and space saving. Update:  owned 9 months and the handle has broken.  A dish touched the inside of the window and the window began to melt/burn, very strange.  It does not wash off.  Only 2 adults in this house and microwave is not used much.  Never did use wifi .  Wish they would focus on a BASIC great little microwave and skip the wifi.

So now it works fine. No where did the directions give any clue what to do if it didn’t connect.  I thought to try this and it worked. The microwave works very well with Alexa. I really like it.

  I bought this when it first came out in 2018. since then it has worked well but I only use it 2-3 times a week to heat up coffee in an upstairs room if the coffee gets cold before I finish it. Today I read on CNN that the microwave is a fire hazard and, sure enough, when I checked the brown plate just below the bump on the right side of the microwave I see burn damage just where the CNN reviewers found it on their faulty machine.  I have no idea how long it has been there. Even though it is out of warranty I will try to return this as other reviews and the CNN article make it clear that the manufacture was faulty and the machine is a fire risk.

  I should've kept the box & returned it instantly. Instead, I thought I'd give it a chance. Upon first use & ever since, there's been a faint burnt plastic smell. The first time I used it the smell was very strong. It has faded but not vanished. About a week ago the turntable started acting up & getting off track for some unknown reason. It makes the loudest THUMP & scares the absolute crap out of me. Most of the time it spills anytime in the microwave. The power level/heating is the absolute worst part. I've tested multiple things, both hot on cold on the same temps. I heated up some quick WELL YES! soup 3 times the other day on the high setting, as always, for the same amount of time. Once it wasn't warm at all, the 2nd time it was scalding hot & I burnt my mouth, the 3rd time it was just avg warm. Total waste of money but I don't have the box or the mental energy to stress about sending this piece of trash back.

  I have a full-size microwave in my kitchen, installed above my stove - STUPID and dangerous.  I ordered the Alexa microwave and I am very happy. However, I have two complaints.  First it was a pre-order so seemed to take forever to get here.  Second I didn’t pay attention to the maximum size of popcorn bag that can be used. It is smaller than the typical, 3 vs. 3.5 oz.  The microwave is here now I’m very happy with it and I’ll adjust to a smaller bag of popcorn.There are many people who would love the have this, my first thought goes to seniors. As we age it often times gets more difficult to see, being able to speak to Alexa to start your microwave can be a God send.  As I write this the last day of November 2018 I’m thinking what a wonderful Christmas gift! However, birthdays, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day or simply, I love you, this would make a great gift anytime. Yes is small, so perhaps not appropriate for a large family unless it’s a second microwave for the game room or wherever. But for a single person or even a couple this is great.

  Honestly I’m not sure what the point is.  I’ve never been able to control the microwave with Alexa because of the door being closed for too long issue.  It’s literally minutes between when Alexa is useful and when it is not.  If I have to open the door every time why not just stand there and plug in the numbers myself?  It’s so stupid.  I can’t even put something in the microwave and walk away for more than 5 minutes and start it with Alexa.

  This is about the cheapest Microwave on the site and it shows. Its worst drawbacks:1) The fan isnt strong enough to remove the moisture that builds up when heating and cooking leading to dripping water buildup throughout the inside, you have to constantly wipe out the inside with a rag.2) The rotating food plate doesn't contact the drive points under it very securely leading to the drive points constantly losing contact with the food plate. This requires you to readjust the plate often to get the contact points back in contact with the plate.3) The plastic film covering the buttons on the face of the oven started delaminating instantly leading to bubbles and pockets of air obscuring the buttons, particularly over the ""start"" button.4) The size of this oven is so small that many items one would normally heat/cook in a Microwave dont fit. Even large frozen dinners are a challenge to fit in this oven. Cooking bacon requires cutting the bacon in half to get it to fit.5) This is a very low power Microwave.

  IT WOULD NOT SETUP VERY DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE  IT WAS PURCHASED FOR RELATIVE WITH MACULAR DEGENERATIVE AND SHE REALLY NEEDED IT TO WORK. ALEXA WOULD NOT DISCOVER THE MICROWAVE.Before attempting setup, I made sure her Amazon Fire tablet was up to date, her Alexa app was updated, wifi, bluetooth, and location settings were turned on.  I have setup several types of Alexa compatible devices up before with absolutely no problem.  I went to her house, used Alexa app, but after 3 hrs of trying to get it to discover the device I gave up.  I pressed the #2 and held for 4 seconds as directions said to put it into setup mode before doing smart home discover device in the alexa app.  I chose Microwave, and then Amazon Basics, but it would not discover it.  So I came home , contacted Amazon via live chat, no person available due to COVID-19 outbreak.After three hours of questions , checking and double checking, we got the device unregistered from my Amazon account, ( I purchased it) and had it registered into her Amazon account.  After double checking each account it did show in her devices as registered and was removed from my devices.  So I went back to her house again,the next day , and spent  2 hours.  I tried to get help online again , but it wasn't available. So I came home , was eventually able to get help through chat again.  The chat rep. determined that I had done everything possible, and that something else beyond my control was wrong. They immediately offered a refund and  return . I accepted.  Today I decided to try one more time before returning.  I went to my account on the chance that the microwave was somehow linked to my account through simple setup.  I disabled simple setup on my account and double checked that it was enabled in her account.  I went back to her house today, and tried again, but you guessed it, IT WOULD NOT DISCOVER THE MICROWAVE.  So I will be returning it his week.  The worst part is that I was so tickled as was she, to be able to get something that could help her so very much on a daily basis and then not be able to use it.IF YOU CHOOSE TO BUY IT  YOU MAY HAVE NO PROBLEMS BUT I WON'T BE BUYING ANOTHER ONE AND THEN HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. The only good thing was that Amazon was willing to do refund and return without any hassles. Thank you

  The pros are that it's great for small spaces. It is compact and tucks into the corner and has a small footprint.I have owned this for about a year now. It's not that powerful. I often have to double the amount of time I would typically use to cook/defrost something. As far as Alexa compatibility goes, it's really not even helpful. If you put something inside and walk away, and then try to use Alexa, it won't work. Alexa heating up the item has to happen shortly after closing the door. So, I find I just enter in the information as soon as putting it into microwave. So, voice command is just silly to use.So, with voice command being a waste of time, and the power level being half that of regular microwave opens, it's just not a wise investment.Additionally since purchasing this, I keep reading about it being a fire hazard so I am most likely going to just get a new microwave at this point.

  Microwave worked great for the first month.  Then things started to go wrong.  First was the Alexa voice stopped working on it.  We only use it for warming left overs and popcorn. We liked the size it is very small and fits where we want it.  We only microwave in plastic or glass containers.  After 5 months since we bought it, it now literally smokes and buzzes and I'm afraid given the amount of smoke in just 10sec it is going to set on fire.It's a very bad microwave.  Dont buy it.  I did read where others have had theirs catch on Fire. I bought it in Feburary of 2019 and now it's out of the return policy. VERY BAD DECISSION.

  The turntable assembly snapped.Yeah.50 cent part.Nice.Ok, let me contact Amazon for support.Seems they don't sell the part.The solution? A replacement.OF THE ENTIRE MICROWAVE.If you didn't catch that, you need to replace or buy (once the unit is out of warranty) a new microwave.Edit: 4th person i spoke to advised the following. I can return it to the UPS store but since i tossed the box, i need to buy a box there...Amazon said they'd refund me the cost of the box..Will edit this review again if I have issues getting the cost of the box refunded.Absurd support aside, the microwave is quite underpowered, even for a 700 watt microwave. 3-4 minutes to heat up soup? Try 7 minutes for lukewarm soup.

  I've had this in my kitchen now for almost a month and It's a solid little light-duty microwave. But, make sure you know what you're buying before you get too excited about it.The good: it's inexpensive; setup is a snap; Alexa integration works very well; you won't have to bother setting a microwave clock ever again (thank God); voice-control gives it a nice novelty factor.The not-so-good: it's pretty small; 700 watts makes this oven a bit underpowered; black is OK, but a brushed stainless steel version would be better; the LED readout isn't the brightest and gets a bit washed out in a kitchen with a lot of light.If this is a preview of what Amazon has in store for future products, I'm pretty stoked. I'd like to see them address the issues I laid out above and also integrate features like what GE is doing with their smart ovens with ""scan-to-cook"" technology. Essentially, you scan a barcode of whatever you want to nuke and the oven sets the cooking time and power automatically.I'd give it 5 stars if it were a little bigger and more powerful. As is, I'll give it a 4 out of 5 rating. Definitely a worthwhile purchase if you can accept it's shortcomings.

  Honestly I should have immediately returned this microwave. We've had it almost 2 years now but lots of sparking and times where I felt I couldn't leave the room in case it caught on fire.It's small. You can't pop popcorn in it without the sides touching the bag (causing burning). Regular dinner plates fit but frequently have issues turning because it's just a bit off for fit... This can also cause steam/smoke/etc.Alexa integration is a waste of money and pointless. Just don't buy this. Obviously it fits in small spots but that's kinda pointless if you can't use it without starting a fire. The small piece on the side is a bit plastically or cardboardy... When it burnt, we decided to toss this microwave to avoid any more fires. It just seems like a death trap and I want a microwave that I'm not scared of my kids using or standing near...

  BE WARNED, THIS PRODUCT IS A SAFETY HAZARD! I bought this product a little over a year ago. After about a year it would sporadically begin sparking (we always used microwave safe dishes/containers). Last night the microwave finally caught on fire. I had to pick it up and throw it out of the front door. The side panel was totally burned and the house was filled with smoke. Other reviews have mentioned the product sparking, and Amazon have clearly done nothing to fix the problem. The product comes with (I believe) a 6 month return window, so as long as it lasts that long Amazon are covered. They refuse to stand by their product after the window closes.Even when the microwave worked, it was easily the worst I've ever used. It has very low power (lower than a lot of food instructions give guidance for), and it cooks food VERY unevenly. Accounting for the inherent dangers with the product, I would highly recommend avoiding this product. Shame on Amazon for not fixing a dangerous product.

  21.0 + 21.1 = 20.0529.6 + ? = 29.129.1 - 20.05 = 9.05*70 = 633Perfect except for one super-annoying problem: the 1-touch interface requires you to push *TWICE* to start cooking while every other microwave on the planet begins a 30-sec cooking session immediately on the first touch, adding additional 30s to the timer with each additional press. It sounds like a minor inconvenience but it’s the #1 used interface and the additional press serves literally no usable function. I hope they consider a software update to streamline this minor but annoying UE issue.Otherwise, the unit is perfect for our small inlaw unit kitchen. It replaced an old high power 1200W unit and we gained additional storage space from its diminutive size. While the lower 700W power is noticeable, especially the additional time needed for heating liquids from refrigerator temperatures, we have found the benefits of the lower power far outweigh the downsides. Reheating any starch, vegetable, or sugary food is much more consistent throughout with fewer hot spots. Reheating pizza slices is especially ideal with the 700W power limit. Defrosting shows a similar improvement. Bottom line is that not until you experience cooking with a lower power microwave can’t you appreciate how superior the results can be, with only a relatively minor increase in cooking time (45s vs 30s to rewarm a coffee is really just 15s difference). Out of curiosity, I tested the power using the JIS standard test (designed for pre-1990 testing) and it came out to 685W. I’m pretty sure if treated with the more accurate IEC705, it would indeed be 700W.On the Alexa side, it isn't a game changer or anything for day to day use, but really shines for those those rare instances like needing to melt a stick of butter while your hands are fully covered in chicken parts and breading mix :) It’s also a convenient way to set exact cooking time while busy preparing other food. One thing to note is that the unit relies on a separate Alexa enabled device for the integration to function: I moved our Dot from the center of the large studio room into the kitchen section just so Alexa commands to the microwave would register without requiring us to speak louder, or to move our heads toward the Dot when it was across the room.The interior size seems like the result of a doctorate thesis of a new algorithm that exactly determines the minimum size required to fit all available cookware. It’s amazing really how it seems too small to hold most plates, etc, yet they all seem to squeeze right in with millimeters of clearance. …Almost physics defying.Lastly, the rubber feet on bottom work ! We’ve had 3 microwaves located in the top of our refrigerator the last 10yrs, and this is the only one with rubber feet that adequately gripped the textured fridge to keep it from sliding around just from pressing the buttons.You can’t really go wrong with this one.

  The unit itself is a functioning, tiny microwave, but this thing has given me problems since day 1. It's now been a couple of years and I figured I'd write this review while it's on its deathbed.I purchased the microwave because I needed a microwave and I was SO excited to use the Alexa feature. Instead of googling and messing around with power levels, I could tell Alexa exactly what to do and it would do it – yay! I think I tried setting up the Alexa feature around fifty different times and only got it to work maybe once in the history of its existence. Finally, I just gave up and let it live as a regular microwave. So with all that being said, this is not a reliable Alexa device.Another note is that this microwave is itty bitty – great for apartment living, but not awesome if you'd like to set a bowl inside. For the most part, everything fits, but it kind of stresses me out to have items go in and literally scrape the top of the unit.Now more recently the cardboard thing on the side of the microwave caught fire and this is where things get interesting. I immediately unplugged the unit and began to clean it as thankfully it didn't cause any damage that I could see. However, once the unit was clean and sparkling again (but the smell lingered), I went to heat something up and it was again covered in brown liquid and goo. I cleaned it again and ran it again and again, covered in brown liquid, pooling at the bottom. I have NO idea what's going on with this unit or where this brown liquid is being stored within, but I've cleaned it three times and I just opened the door and the dried, burnt sludge is everywhere, so we're calling it quits. I won't be replacing the unit, but I'll probably opt for a nicer microwave that I can get more than two or three years out of.

  I'd give this 0 stars if I could. I love Amazon devices - I have a bunch in my home. I love Alexa integration because it's super convenient. But I hate this microwave. Like another reviewer said, not usual Amazon quality and a pitiful excuse for a microwave.This was an impulse buy back in 2018 when it first came out. The Alexa integration enticed us to try it out. THE ALEXA INTEGRATION NEVER WORKED. This is a 700W microwave....we unknowingly downgraded from a decade-old, working perfectly fine 1100W microwave to this piece of plastic that doesn't heat food and gives off a stink so bad that every time it's on I nearly vomit and it makes the food taste awful.Save your money and don't buy this. I've tried EVERYTHING to get the smell out and I can't. I noticed that there are some marks on the inside ceiling of the microwave, suggesting that the ceiling itself has BURNED. Maybe that's why I can't get the smell out? Today, for the first time in 1.5 yrs I'm looking at the other reviews and seeing that my experience with this device isn't unique. And after seeing other reviewers show and describe how their microwave caught fire...yeah, this is going in the trash today.

  My wife and I have to switch accounts from our Eco Show 5 to use it because apparently it only integrates with one of the Alexa device accounts and shows an error if you try access allowances for other users.The buttons are very difficult to compress and it basically feels like you’re only supposed to use it with voice because the buttons literally have to be pressed hard to function.After a short amount of time and only a handful of uses the glass turntable broke (while ironically microwaving the popcorn it was hyped for being most useful for.)My wife contacted Amazon for a replacement glass turntable unfortunately Amazon doesn’t supply those separately so they are sending us a whole new unit, but we first have to ship back the original.I really like Amazon’s products, I am disappointed they don’t have a more cost effective replacement option for themselves as it seems like a waste of resources to have so much back and forth.Best of luck and I hope y’all are able to address these issues.Keep trying! :-)

   Edited to add : Been using this for awhile now. Horrible Product! Heats unevenly and takes a long time and add to that the water it retains. Less than 1 Star...I needed to replace a microwave and I wanted to go smaller. The Alexa integration was a nice bonus but really not necessary and kind of silly, but I’ll explain later.  I can’t recommend this microwave because I’ve had issues with this one right out of the gate. It retains water. For example, I use Success Rice Boil Bags. 15 minutes in a bowl of water. When done, there’s a good sized puddle of water underneath the glass rotating dish. It doesn’t go away unless you sop it up.  This can lead to mold which I discovered after my vacation. Maybe mine is just defective, but it’s in a well ventilated area with at least 4 inches (if not more) of clearance on every side but bottom of course. It’s not just rice bags, anything that involves any kind of steam. It turns to moisture and stays under the glass plate. See video and picture for example.The “Alexa” part is kind of silly in my opinion. If your putting food in the microwave you’re clearly standing at it. So to call out to your echo dot or echo show whatever to run the microwave for 2 minutes instead of just hitting the number 2 on the keypad seems kind of silly. Now to be fair, I don’t know what the Alexa button on the microwave does... but again... if you’re standing there why would you push the Alexa button instead of just pushing the buttons you need. So it’s kind of silly.

  I bought this microwave for my pantry, all I do is melt butter in it and occasionally warm leftovers. When we remodeled and put the pantry in, I had it wired specifically to hold a microwave; it is on a dedicated circuit.- It is very low power - think microwaves from the 1980s - but I can work around it, I don't use it for that many things.- it is small, which I liked, but some things won't be able to fit and still rotate around. Again, not the end of the world, and certainly not worth replacing it for.- I never hooked up the Alexa on it - I don't understand why I would need to start my microwave from across the room ( I mean, you have to put something in it first, and since you're already there...) - so I can't discuss how easy/difficult that process is.- THEN IT STARTED SPARKING every time I tried to use it. Sorry guys, that's a dealbreaker for me. I bought it in May of 2019 and by February of 2021 it is a useless piece of junk I now have to figure out how to recycle.I will keep searching for a small microwave for my pantry that won't start on fire.

  I never thought I could love a microwave. Never, its a useful tool, it does what it needs to, hit a few buttons and it warns up food, but then... I moved to an apartment that doesn't have a built in, and I had gotten rid of my old one (a hand-me-down that was older than me, and still worked just fine, thank you very much) and was looking for something for my small space.This was actually one of the cheaper ones that fit where I needed it to, and I already have a few echos, so I thought, why not? At worst a functional item, that's also a bit of a joke, and at best, the same, but a funny joke.The ease of set up was fantastic, only issues were having to go into the app to pair it and change the time zone (that and it currently doesn't do military time, which I would like to mark half a star off, but I just Can't).This thing is so easy to use, I can have greasy hands and not want to mess up the buttons, boom, ""alexa microwave one minute""; I can let cool for a moment and while preparing something else, boom ""alexa, microwave two minutes""; I can forget about my tea for a little bit while I am doing chores and now the boiling water is lukewarm again, boom, ""Alexa, microwave three minutes"".You can tell it what you're cooking and have it microwave that perfectly, although I haven't tried that yet, but it's an awesome feature.And it's safe too, it won't microwave anything if the door has been shut over ten minutes. It won't microwave anything for an unreasonable amount of time.Aeshestically its beautiful, sleek, black, gorgeous!

  We got this for my sister in law who is blind, when her last microwave oven died.  What first attracted us to this compact microwave was that Amazon offers a braille overlay for the control pad.  For years we have been sticking dots on her microwave key pads which inevitably fall off. *While the overlay fits perfectly, the flat non-embossed keypad is still not ideal for someone who is visually impaired - the only reason that I took 1 star off, and for someone who is not visually impaired a non-factor.  On the other hand, the integration with Alexa is done very, very well!  With the Alexa dot located in her kitchen, operating this microwave is quick and simple for her (Her voice commands are easily picked up regardless of which way she is facing).  The oven itself is nicely designed with a good handle, compact and will fit in nicely with apartment sized counters.  With it's smaller dimensions and lower power (700 watts) it's best suited to re-heat food and mcirowave-designed meals.  It appears a good choice for anyone who just needs a compact microwave oven, but it is especially ideal for those who either have a visual impairment or difficulty using a keypad controller due to the Alexa integration.  The Amazon Basics Microwave is aptly named: A no-nonsense basic microwave at an attractive price.  It is gratifying that the available braille overly (at all of $0.99) and Alexa integration did not add much to the price.  NOTE: Amazon also offers this microwave oven packaged with the Alexa Dot for those desiring this feature who don't have an Alexa device.

  The wheels for the turntable are the wrong size and makes it keep falling off.  I ordered a $6 replacement wheels that should be smaller and fit better.

Since I had to investigate and figure out what was wrong with the microwave Amazon sold me.I could have returned it, you say?  And somehow in your universe, packing up a microwave into your car to take it to the UPS store, is easier than ordering a $6 part to fix it?  I wish I lived in your world.  In mine, it's easier to figure out what's wrong.But wtf?????  I'm just left with a big huge wtf that will always pop into my head now when I go to heat a cup of coffee.So it's a nice microwave, even though voice command takes a little getting used to.  But I minus 2 stars because it came with the wrong wheels.  How many people won't figure that out and live with a plate that slips all the time?  That's the thing.... hopefully they'll figure out it doesn't have to be that way.  I lived with it for about a week, before I said nuts to this and looked at the design to figure out the problem.

  This is a small, 10 inch turntable, 700 watt microwave.  If you're expecting larger or more powerful that's on you.  I have a very large 1100 watt microwave in the kitchen.  Which shows the time is 0000.  I got this one to be a convenience where I spend most of my time.  It works perfectly.  Fits in a small space and has a small footprint.There seems to be some folks trying to shame folks regarding the Alexa interface.  Here are some of my reason for really appreciating that interface.  First you should never run any empty microwave.  For that reason Amazon has put in a safeguard to not have the interface work if the door has not been opened in the last 10 minutes.  That's unfortunate but necessary.I am pushing 70 and an exlinebacker.  My fingers are huge and keyboards tend to be small.  Alexa solves that.  I have a progressive neuromuscular disease that effects my manual dexterity.  Alexa solves that.  I can put my tea water in and multitask while I have Alexa set the time.  I can operate the microwave without turning on the lights.  I can operate the microwave without tracking down my glasses.  If I warm my tea and get involved I can rewarm it (so long as it's been less than 10 minuets) from another room.Here is the quintessential reason to have the Alexa interface!  As soon as I linked the microwave to Alexa the correct time was displayed on the microwave.  I will never have to set the time on the microwave again and it will never display 0000.

  My wife and I searched high and low for a small microwave that her elderly parents could use. She is completely blind and he is physically not able to use a keypad or a knob to set the microwave. This unit has given them back a bit of independence. DOesn't sound like much, but every little thing you can do without asking for help is an accomplishment! The unit has a very small footprint, which takes up very little room in their very small kitchen! The interior will accept a regular size dinner plate with ease. The presets have worked very well and we haven't run into any issues of under/over cooking. This unit has filled the bill with flying colors. One thing though, use the smaller, single serve bags of popcorn, as the regular size bags tend to expand to the point of touching the top or sides of the oven, and then it doesn't pop so well.  Small issue as far as we are concerned. For the price of the unit, you can't go wrong. It was packaged very well and arrived on time, and in perfect condition. The setup was easy and took less time to setup than it did to get it out of the box!!! If you are looking for a small microwave that just works, you can't go wrong. We did not subscribe to the popcorn refills, but I did look at the options available and if your a popcorn lover, it might be a good thing to try!!!

  This is an okay microwave as long as you understand that it is a 700 watt unit which is lower than most kitchen unit. There is nothing wrong with it and it just takes longer to cook. The lower power is even desirable for locations with less electrical availability.What is very disappointing is how it works with Alexa. You need an Alexa device near it that you can issue the command because it has no built-in microphone. It is really quicker to just enter the time than telling Alexa via voice. The only time Alexa feature comes in handy is when telling her to do things like reheat 1 cup of coffee, but then you usually know the time it needs.Although it has 700 watts of microwave power, the input power requirement is 1050 watts and is very wasteful of electricity. Not sure where the rest of the power is going.This unit can be controlled by Alexa or via the keypad like a conventional microwave. It does not need Alexa at all if only using it manually.What I hate the most about this unit is that it cannot display the clock in 24-hour format. All clocks in my house, in fact Alexa also, are set to that format so it is confusing to see this clock showing a different time, especially because there is no AM/PM indication. It is a real problem when you work in shifts. To make the matter worse there is no option not to display the clock. This is the only microwave I owned that does not have those options.

  UPDATE: I am changing my review to one star. While the microwave worked well when I first received it, it had issues with the lighting/power issues less than two months later. Amazon was awesome enough to send a replacement (and I shipped the busted unit back to them), however, that replacement is now failing less than six months after getting it. There's something wrong with the way the unit vents humidity - I've made sure there's plenty of clearance on all four sides, that nothing is blocking any of the vents, and that there's nothing on top of the microwave - and yet there's constant condensation on the inside of the door and roof of the microwave despite my drying it out after each use (which I've never had to do before with any other microwave). This has been going on for the last two months or so, and the first one I had didn't do this, so I have no idea what's going on, but I do know that if a product fails TWICE in less than a year, in two completely different ways, that I cannot in good faith recommend it to friends or leaving a fantastic review. When it worked properly I was happy with this microwave, unfortunately, it doesn't seem to want to keep working right at all.This microwave is compact but cooks things in a fair amount of time - I do have to look out for cooking times that are aimed at higher powered units and then add a bit of time to make up for it. If you don't have a lot of room and don't need the most powerful microwave out there, this is a fantastic buy for the price. I don't use any of the smart home options, so I can't really say how well they work.

I am on my second Amazon Basics Microwave with Alexa integration (if you want to call it that) although it does state it is not a functioning Alexa dot replacement or anything in the description, but this barely qualifies as any type of cooking device.  Whatever you claim as the wattage is a lie.  It puts out about 40 watts.  It cooks so unvenly.  Im going to skip the on and on but the clincher on the first microwave we got, it started to smell like death.  Like something died in it.

  You have absolutely no idea what satisfaction is until you can just say ""Alexa, microwave on high for 5 minutes and 25 seconds"" and it just does it.  Call me lazy if you want, but the convenience is absolutely worth it.Pairing the device to my network via the Alexa app on my phone was a breeze.  I literally had it set up in under 2 minutes.  I just had to add the device to which room I wanted.  You need to make sure there is an existing Echo or Dot in the room to act as the speaker and mic to provide the audio controls.  Once added though, the 'microwave' just works and responds to direct voice commands.  You can control power levels (low, medium, high).  Also you can use phrases like 'reheat pizza' and it will auto select the appropriate settings.The microwave is a little smaller than expected, but later I found is just the right size to handle most of my needs.  It easily fits frozen dinners and the automatic carousel will fit a full size dinner plate.  So that is fine.  The power level is a little lower so you may need to adjust cooking times.  But otherwise - it just works.If you are tech saavy or just a general tech geek, it is wonderful. Also perfect for small size areas like a workroom, dorm (if allowed) or guest room.  Highly recommended.

  First, let me say that this is a well-made microwave, worth the money spent on it even without the Alexa integration. That's why I gave it four stars overall: does have one disappointment, but it's a good buy.The disappointing part is that the Alexa integration is surprisingly weak, especially considering that it's the Amazon Basics brand. It can be set using voice (such as ""cook this for 3 minutes""), but its only preset is for popcorn. It also cannot be controlled using the Alexa app.What I'd hoped for was a way to say (for example), ""Alexa, reheat this pizza,"" and Alexa (via a Routine, or otherwise) and/or the microwave would know what level to heat at and for how long. Or, set up a Routine so the microwave finishing sends a notification throughout my apartment (popping the microwave door open is probably too much to ask). I've also had microwave instructions in the past where I was supposed to heat at one level for a time, then heat at another, and it would be good to be able to have this done automatically through a Routine or some other user-built program.Still, don't let the word count on this complaint discourage you. Despite this disappointment, this is still a good, solid microwave, and worth the investment.

  I like the compact size and voice control but the power and heating in general leaves a lot to be desired.I hadn't used a microwave in 7ish years before I purchased this, just because I already had an echo and it was at a discount at the time. I didn't really know what to expect, but I started finding that everything would take an additional 2-3 minutes beyond the recommended time to heat properly. I started noticing that sections would be colder than other sections. This doesn't lend very well to a great microwaving experience!I now realize this is a 700w microwave as opposed to a normal 1000w plus microwave, but I'm not sure why we're lacking the necessary watts for the average foodstuff?Wifi hookup was a bit tricky mostly because my kitchen has a bad connection and the app is a little hard to use. I managed to get it working but every now and then, when comcast decides to kill my wifi for maintenance or whatever, the microwave does not automatically reset. Instead Alexa unhelpfully informs me it can't do that! Until of course I unplug and replug the whole thing. Compared to google products, which reset like they were never disconnected, this can be a bit frustrating.Actual use is pretty good. The voice control works great, and saves me countless seconds of trying to type on buttons which are not very sensitive. I don't personally care much about the popcorn feature, but it would have been made a LOT more useful all around if the microwave had included a weight plate inside to measure the ounces itself. This may be a problem of magnetics, but if it were solved that would have brought this microwave to a whole new level. As it is, the vaunted weight cooking features are kind of useless for how much work you have to do when you could say, just read the popcorn bag.Overall, it cooks if not so great and I did get it for a cheap price. As an avid amazon customer, I'd love for them to redesign this beast to have some of the features I mentioned and just work better as a microwave in general whether in terms of wattage or fixing a design flaw. The fact that they got wifi working at all on a microwave had to have caused some trade offs.If you're in the market for a new microwave you're probably better off with a slightly more powerful one. I'd wait until the next generation of this, unless it's already abandonware.

  All the features on this microwave worked as they should for the first year and 1/2.  Alexa integration was easy and useful.  We really liked the microwave until one night it started on fire.  Luckily we were in the kitchen when it happened so I was able to take it outside before anything happened.I called Amazon asking about their warranty.  The first lady I spoke with said they only had a year warranty so there wasn't anything that could be done.  I explained the situation explaining that we were not going to pursue legal council for their microwave possibly burning down the house but we would like a refund or replacement.  After placing me on hold she came back and said I think we can do that.  Wow, thanks!Amazon sent a replacement microwave, as I said before we liked the microwave.A month after receiving the replacement we received an email from Amazon that they were going to charge us for the replacement microwave unless we shipped back the burned one.  What?  Who keeps a burned microwave??Lesson here is stay away from the Amazon branded microwave as its a fire hazard and they don't properly back their products.Update:  Amazon Customer service reached out and made everything right.  Would do business with Amazon again.

  This product is a good microwave - heats well BUTMost microwaves with a turntable rotate at a rate of one revolution in 10 seconds. This matches up well with the quick keys on most microwaves.BUTThis microwave turntable rotates at of one revolution in 12.5 seconds. This does not work very well when heating something with a handle (like a coffee cup). if you hit the start button for a quick reheat it is timed as 30 seconds which ends with the handle in the back....(:30 / 12.5 - 2.4 revolutions).  Most of the alexa quick-cook voice presets also do not match up with the 12.5 seconds. The only one that matches is reheat 1 cup of coffee = 1:15  / 12.5 = 6 revolutions.  Amazon needs to change the presets and / or provide a user the method to pre-program a preset via alexa - create routine. The create routine allows to preset routines for smart home devices BUT the microwave is not a smart home device even though it is an alexa powered device..

  The entire point of making a microwave you can just talk to, is so you don't have to bother getting up--so, what is the stupidest thing Amazon could possibly do to this microwave? You guessed it, deliberately cripple the microwave, so that you are FORCED to get up anyway, to open and close the door before talking to it so you don't have to get up. What the devil is that? That's the stupidest middle finger ever. They create this great device--and then just deliberately cripple it for no reason at all. THAT IS STUPID!--and it's annoying, because there's now no point at all in having this stupid microwave!Whenever an organization does something really stupid, but decides it's too expensive or too big a hassle to change, they try to sell it as a safety feature. What on earth is it about forcing you to get up and go to the microwave to pointlessly open then close the door again for no reason at all, that makes it safer to operate? That's just TRANSPARENTLY STUPID, STUPID, STUPID!!!THIS IS AS STUPID AS SELLING A CAR THAT WON'T START UNLESS THE DOOR IS OPENED WITHIN THE LAST 10 MINUTES, AND TELLING PEOPLE IT'S A SAFETY FEATURE.

  I read the reviews about spontaneous combustion, and thought: well, maybe these other people didn't know what they were doing, or maybe it's just a random thing.  However, after less than a year of use, it started sparking and setting things on fire in the unit.  And yes, I'm a pretty advanced microwave user - I wasn't accidentally nuking foil or something.I can review the other features, but honestly, if your appliance randomly catches fire, maybe it doesn't matter that you can ask alexa to heat up your burrito?  That seems like the kind of thing you might recall your appliance for, I don't know.  Maybe actual houses have to burn down or something.  Anyway, if you're willing to take the risk, the alexa integration works well, but the microwave itself is super tiny and takes forever to heat stuff up.  (Except when the fires start, and then it's much quicker.) Personally, I'm going to replace mine with a safer microwave that may require me to press buttons.

  I just got this today so I will update if there are any issues as I noticed some people had some. I did not have any issues at all and here is a helpful hint.If you already have an Amazon Alexa device, when you actually order this microwave if you check off the box that says ""add this automatically to my account"", then when it arrives and you plug it in, it automatically connects I did not have to go through all that hassle going through the app on my phone. I basically just plugged it in and watched it connect itself and set it's clock itself. You just have to remember to click that box when you order that says to automatically add it.It is small and compact and so was my other one that quit working, so I was used to the size. However, you can put a dinner plate inside of it and a frozen dinner and just about any normal thing. Obviously you're not going to be cooking a turkey in a microwave anyway.If you live in a small apartment like I do it is perfect. Also I don't really use the Alexa feature. I just use it as a regular microwave because I figure if you have to walk to it to put your item in, how hard is it to hit a button? LOL

  Was a good little microwave for about 2 years with little use, and in the last months it's gotten used about once a week and a couple days ago it decided it had had enough and straight blew up.A spot inside bubbled out (melted the METAL panel folks) and the power flickered and it made this crackling noise before I got to it and opened it enough to turn it off. Promptly unplugged it and then gave it a minute to cool off before opening and discovered the bubble on the inside.I obviously did get 2 years' use out of it, and can't return it...but the longevity of the unit is questionable at best, and the safety hazard is a thing to consider.

  It started making noises, then started sparking.. I had to rush to turn in off.  Purchased on 10/2019 with very limited use, started burning up and sparking Jun 2020.

  It's neat to be able to say ""Alexa, defrost 1 pound"" or ""Alexa, microwave 2 minutes"" but as far as carrying things out, it runs hot and cold.. literally.It does ok for reheating coffee or warming something but when given a chore like reheating a bowl of Mongolian Beef... it fails miserably...  After 2 minutes, some is too hot to touch while some is still cold. It took nearly 5 minutes to heat it enough so it all was warm.The microwave has also lost it's Echo connection a few times and had to go through the whole set-up process again.(UPDATE) Around 18 months after purchase..... today my wife was using it and it started sparking and burning so I assume it's dead!My last microwave of another brand lasted more than 10 years.The fire hazard is the last straw...... not worth it even if it's free.

  I have so many complaints about this microwave: 1. The main reason I bought this microwave was because I wanted a SMART microwave. It was terrible to set up and randomly quit altogether interfacing with Alexa. 2. Well beyond smart capabilities, the main reason for having a microwave is to have, well a microwave. This thing is awful. For one thing it doesn't vent correctly and it accumulates all kinds of moisture and smells bad all the time even with constant cleaning. I have no idea what is going on. 3. I wanted a small microwave because at the time I had little counterspace. In this one respect, it does not disappoint. In fact, it is so small you can barely fit a standard plate in it. I definitely regret this purchase and a year in it is too late to return and does not offer support. It's fair to say I absolutely hate this microwave and I've had my share of bad microwaves, but this one takes the cake. For the money it costs, you would expect at least a good working microwave even if the technical aspects fail. It has neither the functionality nor the bells or whistles promised. I am on the look out for a standard, good working microwave now.

  This microwave stinks.  It literally puts off a bad smell every time it's used.  I've tried pulling it far back from the counter and putting it in different locations thinking maybe the problem was ventilation, but that's not it.  The stench after popping popcorn is especially bad.  Notice the side panel inside has burned in the month I’ve owned the microwave. I'd like a refund or the opportunity to replace it with a different microwave.Also, the novelty of having Alexa operate the microwave wears thin early on, especially if there is more than one Amazon account in a household.  Our home is very smart, complete with automated lights, the thermostat, etc., but this product doesn't bode well for automated kitchen items.  There's potential for this feature, but I don't think it's there yet -- at least not with this model.

  You have to reset it every time you switch internet providers. Press and hold 7 & 9 for 4 seconds. Once it clears, Press and hold 2 for 4 seconds, it will beep once. Open your app and it will ask to add it.I’ve had this microwave for nearly 2 years now. It is very small. It burns the corner of regular size microwave bags. Other than that, it is a very cool microwave. I renamed Alexa ‘Computer’ and I love saying, “Computer, microwave, 3 minutes,” when I have a new guest at my house. The look of amusement, then surprise, then awe, is really fun for me. It impresses guys and small children.The voice function is also really handy for someone as easily distracted as I am. I cannot tell you how many times I’ve realized I’ve goofed from across the room and called out to stop the microwave. Computer can stop it faster than I can get to it.All in all, I highly recommend. Just stay close with your popcorn to avoid fire.I do hope to eventually replace this one with a slightly larger one, with all the same features, but I am not in any rush. It is delightful product and one of my favorite purchases.

  I was gifted one of these by a relative in mid October 2019. I had only had it for a few weeks when a large bubble in the paint formed in the right side of the microwave, just above the metal plate. When I tried to use the microwave after that, it started scorching around the bubble and on the metal plate, and started making this ominous buzzing sound. I asked Amazon for a replacement and they accommodated me, however I have literally only had it for 2 days, and my roommate had only used it twice in that time and me only once, and I open it to use it and there's a bubble in the paint in the same spot as the old one. I called Amazon customer service, they were very helpful, they're letting me get a refund. Five stars for Amazon customer service, I would give zero Stars if I could for this microwave.

  This is my first and most likely last adventure into Amazon branded products. I feel like this is my first time correcting a review to remove stars. The performance and quality of these microwaves appears to be as inconsistent as Amazon's ability to deliver within their promised time frame.The first microwave they delivered developed a strong and unpleasant odor on the inside. So powerful was there odor, it permeated any food placed within rendering it inedible. To be fair, I contacted Amazon and they were quick to process an exchange. Hindsight may give pause to wonder if it was too quick as if they expected some issues.The replacement smelled ok. No horrifying odors impacting the food. Having said that, the replacement has its own unique performance issues. After a few weeks it began generating loud and worrisome noises when operating. Sometimes sounding like the chain lift pulling a wooden rollercoaster uphill. Sometimes letting go an annoying almost metal on metal scraping noise. Complimenting the noises was a noticeable reduction of efficacy. It seemed to take longer to cook items. The device then lost connection to Alexa making vocal operation (arguably the feature that is most unique to the appliance) impossible. Several attempts have been made to correct the issue, both on my own and with the help of Amazon support, without success. This caused a return to the button-push operation akin to any other ordinary microwave, and new issues. The clear film on the keypad appears to be of extremely poor quality. After only a few uses, the buttons show a  wear-&-tear that is normally only seen after years of use. At the very least, the asthetic now matches the performance, as bad as that may be.I'm not able to garner assistance from Amazon as it has been over 12 months since the first one was purchased. The replacement is not a year old, but that doesn't appear to matter.Needles to say, I need a new microwave. I bet Wish.com can offer a better one for less cost.Mysteriously, when attempting to save this review, I get a generic error ""something went wrong"" and I cannot save. *Pretends to be shocked*

However after the first few months I noticed sparks occurring inside the microwave. This was not consistent at first and would only happen once in a while. I thought that maybe it was a certain ingredient in the food that would cause it to do this, but my husband who is an electrician assured me this was not normal.

  OK, it lasted just short of 1.5 years. The inner wall burned thru to the METAL (not good) and caught on fire. Luckily I was nearby and saw the sparks/flashes and turned it off.Was OK while it worked but not great; now It's a brick for the landfill.****I needed a new microwave since my old one, while still working fine after MANY years, was pretty gross. (Couldn't possibly reflect my homemaker skills & habits.) Black Friday deal w/free Echo Dot seemed like perfect time to get a new one.Without making this too long, I'm disappointed that my trusty old coffee mug - bought on a ski trip before you were born - did NOT fit in this microwave! If I remove the rotating glass plate (identical to my old machine's, by the way), then I can get it in there, sort of at an angle. Which leads to second issue: POWER. I could heat coffee in 1:30 previously; now it takes 2:30-3:00.Only thing as important to coffee to me is...bacon! Old machine cooked bacon really well, producing grease in the ""gutter"" of my slotted plate designed for makin' bacon. This microwave takes twice as long (literally) and doesn't get it crispy, and creates a greasy ""film"" on the plate, with no hot liquid runoff at all.One night I left a cup of cold coffee in the microwave, and in the morning from bed asked Alexa (on my also-new Fire HD 8 tablet) to heat it for three minutes. She said, ""the over door has been inactive too long"". So I went out to the kitchen, pushed the Alexa button, said ""three minutes"". Nothing. So I went to the Dot, said Alexa, microwave for 3 mins, and she said same thing as in bedroom - over door inactive too long. So finally, I went to the microwave, pressed Start, then again & again & again until 3 mins. So that was disappointing...My old microwave over was small - could barely fit a Costco lasagna in it, for example - and I thought it was fairly low on power. I doubt I'll be able to fit the lasagna in this unit, and it will take much longer to cook if it does fit.Alexa DOES work except when it doesn't; I suspect over time I'll simply ignore it. Oven could use a ""minute"" button along with the Start button's 30 seconds, and the door could use a ""release mechanism"" to push instead of using the handle to pull open. The plastic prongs that secure the door are bound to wear out faster than if separated to release with a push mech.All in all the price was nice, Alexa is sorta useful, but the microwave is very small and seems short on power. Final verdict: Meh.

  I read other reviews that said this thing was small.  I was not prepared for how small it really was.  It was a Prime Day purchase.  I would never have bought it if it didn't include a free Amazon spy, I mean echo dot.  Our main microwave was a behemoth compared to this thing.  I didn't want to replace my good microwave, but the door latch was worn out, and it was difficult to shut.  Finally giving into the wife and kids, I bought this thing.  They all immediately told me to get the old microwave back.  This was going to be the basement microwave.... then the old microwave literally blew up.  We have been using this thing for 2 months.  It is underpowered and tiny.  I can't even fit our bit plates in this thing without implementing some origami, space-time continuum manipulation.  Food that would take 1 minute to heat up in the old microwave takes 1:30 in this one.  I'm never going to use the Alexa features on this thing.  For one, I have to use another device to control this.  I can't just say Alexa, heat up my food.  I have a child with disabilities and autism.  If I enabled Alexa, I would have a nuclear meltdown in my kitchen (note: that is technically impossible with microwaves and only meant to be an exaggeration of what would happen).All in all, it works.

  First impressions:I loved the novelty of voice control. I loved the easy, almost too eager, integration with Alexa. The microwave became connected automatically, while I was still dumbly reading the directions. I liked the presets that I was able to use. I disliked that the presets are very limited. Amazon promotes the presets a little too much for what's being offered. Still, the presets are a bonus, and I'm happy enough. I liked the size of this microwave - it is not a beast like my old microwave, but this microwave is big enough. The visual design of the microwave is pretty generic - and I liked that, no surprises or weird choices. It would have been nice if the microwave could open its own door, but that is not a feature. I tried. I have used the microwave to make water for tea, and heat up spaghetti sauce. The power cord is very thick and a bit short. The cord is three, maybe four feet total length.I love not having to press buttons like some primitive savage being trained, Pavlov-like,  to press buttons for a treat. My last microwave had several non-functioning buttons and one or more barely functional buttons. Voice control requires more presence of mind, and I feel a little higher on the evolutionary ladder for using it.It's been three hours since I set this thing up on my kitchen counter. From the back, the microwave looks like it totally belongs - as if it's been there for quite some time. From the front, I feel a little thrill just looking at it. This microwave was not expensive. For a $60 appliance, I am not expecting miracles, but it is obvious that I will get my money's worth.If anything changes, I will edit my review. So far, I am impressed.Edited on 6/17/2020:I am getting a lot of use out of the presets - heating water, reheating soup, sauce and defrosting frozen vegetables. For example, ""Alexa, defrost 4.6 ounces of frozen vegetables"" is giving me perfectly defrosted veggies with no guesswork. I use a kitchen scale for weighing the vegetables beforehand. The witty people wondering aloud ""But why have voice activation?"" are (understandably) ignorant of the benefits. You would have to know someone who actually uses one of these microwaves to appreciate the convenience. I am looking forward to defrosting stir fry rice at some future date. Very happy with this purchase.In case you are wondering, no, you cannot set up custom routines or custom presets - probably for safety reasons, so that some fool doesn't nuke his house or set the appliance on fire.

  I got this microwave/Alexa Dot combo for my 91-year old Mother.  She lives in a small apartment in an Assisted Living facility.  She has Macular Degeneration and is legally blind.  She has been wanting a microwave for a while, but she has limited room to place a regular sized microwave and would never be able to see the small control buttons to operate it.

Allow me to elaborate the differences.Amazon Microwave:PROS:-Cheap and affordable, comes with Alexa integration and generally is a nice little microwave.-Very quaint, not too big, easy to clean and maintain.-If you need one in a pinch, this is it.CONS:-Takes twice as long to heat products: This isn't an exaggeration, a product like a frozen breakfast which would normally take two minutes in an optimal microwave took twice as long at four minutes. The heating was always, from day one, longer than any microwave I've ever had.-Water drip: Seriously, I've never seen a product where the water melt pools beneath the circular in such a way as to drip out so easily.-Dead: This microwave died within the span of six months. Dead, quit working, didn't even heat anymore. Kept spinning around, turned on, no heat. Very inferior product. No service from Amazon either, no way to contact for help, very extremely dissatisfied.Wal-Mart Microwave:PROS:-Cheap and affordable, came delivered within one day of my order.-Quaint and stylish, while the push button to open it doesn't exist, and instead is a handle on the door at the top, it's very nice addition to my kitchen shelf.-It heats: Like, a lot, like a huge microwave would. It heats food in the time it should take instead of twice as long and there isn't generally any pooling of water.-Push button timer: If you press one, it'll start instantly at one minute timer down, up to six minutes (number six on pad). Better than the Amazon one because the Amazon one while you pressed six and it shown six minutes, you had to press start.CONS:Small, seriously, that's my only gripe. Overall it's pretty damn good and affordable.

  Initially I liked this Appliance. The ability to control it verbally was fun. Then one day it decided to arch and tried to catch the kitchen in fire.  I then read elsewhere that this is a known issue with this specific brand/unit, and that there was pending class action suit.  When it works it was ok. Not very powerful, took longer to heat thinks than previous microwave.  But after it became possessed it's really not worth the price, unless you are looking for an insurance claim.

  Seriously, I mostly use a microwave for popcorn and heating water for my Aeropress coffee maker. I needed a small functional microwave to meet these simple needs. It is a bonus that it is integrated with Alexa. I put a measured amount of water in a Pyrex measuring cup at night to heat up in the morning for my coffee. What I discovered was that if it has been a certain amount of time that the door of the microwave has not been opened the commands to Alexa to start your microwave do not work. I would imagine it's a safety thing. I do wish there was a way to override this so that when I get up in the morning and I could just tell Alexa to microwave the water that's already in the microwave. So now I have to walk over to the microwave open the door and close it and then tell Alexa to microwave for a certain amount of time. One function that I wish would be incorporated would be that Alexa would tell you when the microwave timer was up. If I'm in another room I can't hear when the microwave stops so it would be nice if Alexa could announce that fact.

  Decent little microwave, enough that I bought it twice.  But I ruined the first one because I didn't realize that this thing collects condensation like no other microwave I've ever had! By the time I noticed, the paint was bubbling and coming off and it started to rust!  I bought another one with the intention of just trying to keep up with the condensation and be diligent with wiping the inside down every time. The price was good and I liked the other features.  Size is also great for our small kitchen. But I probably won't buy it again if I can help it.  Having it synced with wifi is nice, but I never use the Alexa features anyway.  Faster to just press the darn buttons lol.

  Please do not buy this microwave unless you are just wanting it as basically a toy. It is small, the Alexa integration is only moderately functional (a problem with Alexa, not the microwave, admittedly), and ours RUSTED inside after only 2 years. We noticed a couple of months into having ours that despite regular wipe-downs and monitoring for spills, it was developing mold inside. We clean it and clean it and still, seemingly overnight sometimes, it will be full of mold. Yesterday when I was cleaning mold yet again I noticed that the top left corner of the inside of the microwave is rusting, and it appears to be doing so rather aggressively. We live in a humid climate but we have never had a microwave do this before. We had our previous microwave over a decade and it was still in good working order when we switched to this one (big mistake).I purchased this microwave as a gift for my husband because he is obsessed with voice control everything. He is always asking alexa to microwave it for weird times like 37 seconds or 2 minutes and 12 seconds. About 50-60% of the time, Alexa gets it right and it works right away. I prefer to just hit the buttons because I find it to be faster. Due to the mold and rust issues, we will be replacing it as soon as possible. I'm disappointed in the quality for the price, especially considering how TINY this microwave is. There are plenty of Alexa-integrated microwaves on the market from reputable appliance brands - buy one of those instead.

  It fit perfectly in the small space I had for a microwave. The wattage was low at 700 but I adjusted to adding extra heating time. It occasionally would disconnect from Alexa for no apparent reason but I put up with that. Then exactly 16 months later it quit working with no warning. I tried to use it and it sparked as if foil was in the microwave. I checked, cleaned it out thoroughly and tried a second time with the same results. I had the impression that if I didn't turn it off immediately and unplug it, it would have burst into flames. Naturally all warranties are no longer in effect so I'm without a microwave. Next time I'll just spend the money and buy a quality product.UPDATE: Amazon contacted me about the microwave and after explaining what happened they sent link for return postage and gave me a partial credit. I thought that was very nice since it was out of warranty and they weren't obligated to do anything. I hope they can find the issue and if it is just a one off thing then maybe check some process they have in production. Like I said it was a really good microwave up to that point. That's why I'm now giving it 3 stars. Maybe it was just a fluke thing.

  I just got this microwave on the 14th when it was released. I ordered it a few days earlier and it was delivered on release day. So far its been really good and works just like a regular microwave. Its a little smaller than a premium size one but great for a small space like a dorm or apartment. The alexa smart control works very well. The only problem is voice commands only work if you have a echo dot or echo device. Sometimes it feels a bit strange to tell alexa to microwave for 2 mins while standing right in front of the unit. Overall this is a great microwave for the price and i would definitely recommend it for anyone who already has a echo device or needs a replacement.

  We needed a microwave, and since we had just started using Alexa at home I figured we'd give it a shot, since it was around the same price as ""normal"" microwave at around the same strength.We never ended up using Alexa with the microwave.  It simply seemed more trouble to verbally tell her what to do only to have to repeat several times.  And we never got into the automatic stuff;  eventually we just used it as a regular microwave.And that's where it's totally frustrating us.  We were paring down from a huge, powerful microwave to something significantly smaller, and we knew there would be a learning curve as far as how long to set it to heat up whatever we're heating up (what normally took a minute might take a bit longer).  But 8 months later we still haven't figured it out how long it takes to cook or reheat stuff.  Even following the directions on the package becomes a hit-or-miss event, and I have to break out the thermometer to make sure the food is ready.  Now granted, it always says ""microwave times may vary"" but it has NEVER been this bad before.So we're going to buy another microwave and maybe use this one as popcorn maker or for instant oatmeal, which are the only things it can consistently prepare.

Then it said FAIL on the display. Then it started working. What the heck? I didn't get this microwave to use with an Alexa feature or anything, I just use it as a microwave. I don't recall this item needing to warm up, or anything like that before. And it most assuredly never said FAIL. Is this normal? I'm still within my return window but I hate returning things! HELP!UPDATE: 2/24/21: In effort to troubleshoot, I tried the microwave for a fourth time. It did the same exact thing as the third time. Then it settled on 12:00 with no flashing... I am at a loss.

  Was excited to buy this little microwave since it fit well in the kitchen space and we didn’t need anything bigger,  It also is a neat feature to use Alexa with it in case your fingers are dirty and you don’t have to touch the control panel! But alas, the microwave is faulty and I should’ve listened to the negative reviews! The metal portion inside the microwave (picture attached) blew up and almost lit fire.  Good thing i was nearby to stop the microwave immediately when i heard the zapping noises.  Amazon should know better to sell this product and not allow people to purchase it or fix the issue!  Not sure if this is adding bad substance to the food, but when i wiped that metal plate, it left metal sprinkles all over the cloth.  At first I thought i had foil on my plate, but no, it was the microwave making electricity noises on its own! I tried to chat online with Amazon product services but it didn’t allow me to for some reason.

  Having used other cheap microwaves, this is a home run for $60.  Even if you took away the Alexa functionality, this is a pretty solid, small microwave for this price point.  It has some neat little extras that I've never seen at this price.-Has turntable/carousel-Has interior light-There are 1-6 dashes ""------"" which light to indicate power level while cooking-When you connect it to Alexa, the time sets itself automatically.-Voice activation works quite well (but typing is still often quicker than your voice)----->Additional things I hated on old units that aren't issues with this one:-The inside door on this is cleanable glass.  (some have mesh screen allowing un-cleanable goo to outer window... gross)-The beeping stops the moment you open door or press stop.  (some units just keep beeping.... Like, I know.  It's done.... I opened the door... Quit beeping already)-The footing is solid.  (No sliding around on counter and moving as you open or close the door)Bare in mind, this is a small microwave, if you are used to 1,000+ watt units, the 700 watts this puts out may be a disappointment.  That's basically the only ""con"" I can think of.  You may have to adjust how you cook things or skip this unit for something more powerful.-If amazon ever makes a larger unit, I'm buying it.

  I've not tested any of the Alexa features, but as a microwave this is pretty mediocre.  The most annoying problem is that the glass tray will very easily slide off the three pronged plastic part, which is supposed to engage it so it turns.  Today the glass tray almost fell out as I removed a mug I was heating water in, and this happens often enough I have to wonder how long it will be till it does side out before I can catch it.  It looks like the bearing ring with the wheels, which the glass tray rests on, is too tall by several mm, which causes the instability.  I also noticed that it takes longer to heat things, though this is more a function of wattage, it is still worth considering.  As an example, a microwave dinner that should heat in 5 minutes will take at least 9-10 minutes.  Unless you are needing the Alexa integration I'd get something else.

  I wanted to like this microwave. Gave it a few months of using it, but it just is not good. It’s given off crazy smells. One moment it would work great, the next it would be terrible. And now it’s been  CATCHING FOOD ON FIRE. I’m talking about food that should not catch on fire. I was heating up sweet potato chunks for my toddler, and heating it for only 15 seconds, on a completely microwave safe plate, and it STARTED A FIRE IN THE MICROWAVE, with a horrible electronic burning smell and what looked like a lightening storm going on. Needless to say, I am incredibly angry with how dangerous this product is, and how low quality it was, even when it did “work”. Also, this food fire wasn’t the only time it’s burnt. It was just the worst incident so far. Currently, the microwave is going in the trash.

  I purchased this microwave because of its low wattage. The microwave takes longer to heat up food than most which is workable but I just joined the list of the other people who decided to make popcorn and it caught on fire. The fire was so big I couldn’t extinguish it without putting the entire burning bag into the sink. My microwave now has a hole burned into the side of it and I’m guessing is no longer safe to use.11/24/20 - This microwave is unfortunately extremely dangerous, it caught on fire today while trying to microwave a bagel dog.

  I received my Alexa controlled microwave today. I unpacked it and it looks great. It is compact and well built. The power cord is heavy duty, and the finish is nice. Connecting the microwave to the internet was fast and painless using the Alexa app on my phone.There are dozens of preset commands like cook 1 potato, reheat 1 cup of coffee, defrost 10lbs of meat. Looking through the preset reheat commands, there are commands to reheat, a sandwich, burger, dinner plate and more, but no command to reheat a slice of pizza! Come, on give us a pizza preset :) You can use a preset command, or simply say turn the microwave on for 3 minutes at power 8 for example. So far, it has been exceeding my expectations.The only cons are that it would have been nice if it was a little bigger say 1 cubic ft, but I new what I was buying. and the other is, the turntable wheel assembly seems a bit fragile. though it may be an illusion. Time will tell, but for now I am giving this two thumbs up. Works as advertised!

  We had this microwave for about a year. It was great to have at first because we needed a microwave quick because we moved into our house and it didn't have one. We were intrigued with the Alexa integration, but tbh we didn't use Alexa all but half a dozen times. It was just easier to push the buttons. It's small, so larger plates and dishes were kinda crammed. It also took extra time to reheat food because of the low wattage. However, the biggest problem was that randomly after about a year of having it, it started sparking. I thought maybe one of us accidentally left something with foil on it or put a metal utensil in it, but no one had. We had recently purchased a built in microwave and were waiting for delivery on it, so maybe this little thing sensed it was being replaced. However, it was kinda dangerous for it to just start sparking randomly after a year of working fine, so just be cautious as this microwave ages.

  This microwave is actually smaller than I thought it would be but it’s fine because it fits a normal size dinner plate and seems pretty standard as far as microwaves go.  The last microwave I had I replaced because the numbers were blue and for some reason, I have a hard time seeing blue lights.  Thus, I couldn’t really see the time too well on that microwave.  However, this one has green numbers so I can see it perfectly.  There aren’t really any preprogrammed buttons on this except for popcorn but everything is written just inside the door to tell you what to say to Alexa.  You literally just tell Alexa things like “defrost half a pound of hamburger” or “cook two potatoes” and she starts the microwave.Best thing is, this microwave is CRAZY QUIET.  I’m so used to loud microwaves that the quietness of this one constantly surprises me.  I find if I’m in another room, I will occasionally have to lean over and check to make sure it’s still on... and it usually is.  It does beep when it’s done but I don’t always pay attention when microwaving.  I often leave the room to go watch something on tv.If I were to say there’s a downside, it would only be that the wattage is probably slightly lower than the average microwave.  I’m not really sure but I think it may take about 10% longer to cook things than an 1100 watt microwave, but every time I think that, I see that the time Alexa inputs is really close to what my last microwave did.I would absolutely recommend and buy this microwave  again... and no one gave me anything for this computer.But you should also know I’m kind of an Alexa whore... I can’t get enough of her and she’s in every room in my house now.  If you don’t want to spend a lot, the price is worth it for this and you can control it with a $15 echo flex if you don’t want to put a show or dot in your kitchen.

  If the date had not passed for returning I would send this item back. About once a week the oven has to be unplugged to bring it back to life. I do not need or want to talk to my oven so I haven't paid the extra money for Alexa features, perhaps it's designed to torture people who do not activate this feature. The timer buttons have to be pressed very hard to set times. The door is so hard to open you have to hold the unit down with one hand while pulling the door open. While Ilike the price it would be great if it worked properly. My last oven lasted 20 years without a hitch.  This unit like most cheap stuff these days is just junk in my opinion.

  I am not rating the Alexa feature as I haven't used it yet although it connected with our Alexa as soon as someone hit the button so I don't doubt it works well. This microwave is excellent for the cost. It's nice and so compact but big enough for reheating stuff which is all that we use it for. It has really opened up our counter space. It's so quiet. It has shocked us all with the silence when it runs. It's unlike any other microwave I have ever heard, if you aren't the person ""microwaving"" then you would likely not know someone is using it. Yes, it is THAT quiet. We bought this one to replace an old larger microwave in our rental with intentions of leaving it whenever we move. Now I love it so much that I'm tempted to purchase another to have for us when we eventually do move. Who knows if Amazon will still sell this one at that time. I don't want to lose out.

  Overall I have to say this microwave is OK. It has its good and bad points.I had no issues at all with setup. The microwave connected to wifi all by itself and set the time. It may have connected to the closest Echo Dot but I don't know because I did the rest of the. setup via the Alexa app.I was looking forward the the Alexa integration simply for the cool factor. That works, at least for the very basic command I tested. ""Alexa, microwave two minutes.""My biggest complaint is the size. IMHO, it is too small for anything except snacks, etc.  Others have complained about the size and I have to agree. I have a big Panasonic that is at least 1100 watts and fits almost anything I want to cook in it. Which means that nearly 100% of my microwave cooking will still be using the Panasonic.Amazon blew it with this one. They released a product to showcase their integration that is too small to really put that integration to use.It might end up being a niche product for college kids or homebound seniors, etc. But, most people will find it too small for everyday use.Note: I live alone with too dogs and I'd say it's too small even for - possibly especially for - a single person. It won't do anywhere near what a single person (at least like me) wants from a microwave.Amazon, next time, give me a nice 1200 watt, around 2.0 cubic foot microwave with Alexa integration!

  Firstly, remember that this is an inexpensive 700W microwave, not so different from what you'd grab at Home Depot or Target as you walked by...it's not the sort of price point that you'd normally agonize over (hopefully).  So, when you compare this oven to those of that type...it's head and shoulders above.The door has a small constriction so that a plate that fits inside may not be able to fit through the door without tilting...so be aware of the opening size...but that's the last caveat.Otherwise, it operates just like a normal microwave...except it doesn't have the confusing matrix of buttons from popping popcorn (not normally so confusing...until you have to remember how to select the size of the package), reheating a bowl of soup (again...not so confusing..but what exactly is a portion?), to cooking a potato (how large is a normal one?), to defrosting chicken (how do you enter lb. and oz. again???).  Instead it just has a simple pad with numbers so that on your first try you can successfully just enter minutes...or just start with 30 seconds...no intuition needed.And then there's the Alexa integration.  What's less obvious is that you'll need an echo dot or some other Alexa device nearby that can hear you from where the microwave is.  That's the hard part...literally.  After that it's totally intuitive...and Alexa will train you if you can't guess how to direct it to do what you want.  The very first time I used it I said ""defrost 1.5 lb. chicken""...and I'll be damned if it didn't do just that.  No guessing...and it worked perfectly.  It thinks in terms of pounds, cups, and ounces...if you know what the thing you want warmed or cooked weighs then you're good to go...that easy.  Amazing.  Anyway...now, weirdly, I actually sort of look forward to using the microwave...sort of the way I like the little chime when your AirPods connect...it's the little things.

  I purchased this microwave in January 2020. It’s now December 2020 and I’m looking for another one. I needed a compact microwave and this fit the bill. However, I noticed from day 1 that the match between the glass turntable and the drive impeller was suspect.In just 11 months, the turntable mechanism is failing. The glass turntable falls off the impeller regardless of what I’m microwaving.  It also makes a grinding and/or a knocking sound and sometimes makes s high pitched screeching noise that’s painful to hear.Other than that. The microwave still works but I’m afraid to use it with liquids because it will cause a safety hazard if the glass turntable falls off the impeller and spills the liquid I’m heating up.

  Updated review changed to 1 star: MICROWAVE BARELY LASTED A YEARIt was never strong to begin with but with regular use, definitely not excessive use, it has died and no longer works. Very annoyed at this.Old review:I actually purchased this microwave for it’s small size and price. The Alexa feature was a plus. I have now had the microwave for a little less than a year, with it being in storage for about 4 of those months.When I first started using the microwave I didn’t even connect it to my Alexa and it seemed to be working fine.I have moved and I’m seeing over time that the microwave power is lessening and it is taking longer to cook things. Seems like a common problem - lack of power. To heat some water, it has taken me about a minute with other microwaves, where this is about 2-2.5 minutes- so seems like its a weak microwave.I really like it’s size seeing as I don’t have a lot of space in my small apartment, and I also like it connects the time through Alexa and I never have to set it, even for Daylights Savings Time. I haven’t really used the other Alexa functions, such as starting/stopping.When this one dies out, I will look around for another microwave it’s size/affordability, but may end up coming back to this one. We’ll see.Overall it’s on OK microwave

  Be careful, this products sparks and will catch fire if not closely monitored. I've nit had it long enough nor does it do major work. I'm truly disappointed. I was all too excited about the connection to Alexa. Bad choice. I had it less than a year before it started doing this.

  Got one of these. It broke in less than a year, but still under warranty. Replaced it and had the same problem. The issue is this: The ventilation is...not. Every time you use this piece of junk you have to remove the turntable and wipe out the puddle that forms when the steam condenses. No matter how diligent you are it will still get through the base, leading to a turntable that is just a table (no turn anymore) and the incredibly easy to clean corrugation seen in the included photo.As for the pairing with Echo...flawless!

  Update: still don’t buy this microwave, but Amazon customer service contacted me and offered to refund the purchase. They were very helpful, but this dangerous microwave must not be sold.Original: Take this off the market now!! We had the popcorn noise and sparks others described. Decided to be more careful and make sure nothing hits the side. Heated leftovers in glass bowl in the middle, nothing touching sides, AGAIN scary noises and sparks. We’ve had a Mac and cheese cup melt and smoke ui the whole house. The condensation is ridiculous, this has to be related to the other problems - just horrible design. It’s marketed to small spaces like dorms. What do they cook in dorms?? Popcorn and Mac and cheese cups (both of which we order from Amazon). We tried to make peace, bought for daughters dorm last fall so warranty is out, BUT COME ON!! This thing is catching fire!! READ THE REVIEWS AMAZON!!

  I  LOVED this microwave.  It would have been a 5 star product had it been 1,000 watts instead of 700…  That, and if it hadn’t decided to try to burn down my home…Right at an hour shy of  850 days, at 5 seconds into a quick 30 second cycle, the magnetron decided to fail in a rather spectacular display of sparks and smoke.  After a terrifying sprint to kill the cycle, kill the breaker, turn on the vents to avoid a visit from the fire department, this is on its way to the dumpster the second I click submit on this review.  (I know I should take it to electronics recycling….  But I really am looking forward to knowing this evil appliance is buried and entombed forever.. )Want a small microwave, that only has a ONE YEAR LIMITED WARRANTY, with Alexa built in, and need it only for a year or two (MAX), I strongly recommend this unit.  Just have a fire extinguisher and ample interconnected smoke detectors…  That, or good insurance!

  ==================================================HERE'S THE IMPORTANT PART OF THE REVIEW!!!!  I'm putting this ahead of the rest of the review to hopefully spread awareness to potential buyers:Around mid-July 2021, I noticed that occasionally the microwave would make a loud buzzing sound & the light inside would flash; this flash seemed more like the current to it was fluctuating, not a timed flash that might be used as an alert.  We've only used the microwave since then while under observation & the abovebehaviors have continued along with wisps of smoke coming from the mesh grill located to the right of the door inside the microwave (the cover in front of the interior light).We've done a fair amount of reading & apparently we aren't alone.  Despite being pretty rigorous about cleaning the interior of the microwave, that mesh cover can allow bits of food, grease, butter, oil, etc. to get into an area of the microwave that we (or any consumer) wouldn't be able to reach for cleaning without a complete teardown of the unit.  Information that we've come across (including reviews currently still up for this product) suggests that continued use of this microwave would constitute a fire hazard.Think about all of this before purchasing, folks.  I'm not worried about cost of another microwave nor am I attempting to force Amazon's hand with this review.  But aside from the safety of my girlfriend & I, we also have neighbors to either side of us & below us to consider.  We can't continue to use this microwave as long as it remains a fire hazard because we don't want to jeopardize our safety or that of our neighbors.==================================================My girlfriend & I purchased this microwave for our new apartment at the beginning of 2020.Connecting the microwave to our internet & then getting our Alexa apps to recognize the microwave was rather painless.  The Alexa implementation is very basic:  you can't talk to the microwave like you can to any device you own running Alexa.  One of those devices must be within earshot for you to ""talk"" to the microwave.  Also, I located a list of commands for the microwave & none of them stood out enough to make me relocate one of my Echos to my kitchen or to bring my phone with me into the kitchen every time I wanted to use the microwave.On the surface, it's an average microwave that doesn't really offer any advantages over any other microwaves in this price range.

  We recently started to integrate our home with Amazon Alexa based technology. We are in love with all of the various offerings. From the echo dot, smart bulbs, nest, ring alarm, blink etc. Since the change to a smart home we have saved about $20 bucks on our electricity bill alone.We decided to upgrade to this microwave because it seemed like a really amazing feature. We have young children and have always had issues with them overmicrowaving. This is turn causes energy waste and higher bills.Since we have upgraded not only have we experienced lower bills our children have become more aware of energy usage which is a huge bonus.The microwave works well. I have experienced no issues with integration to our WiFi and or Amazon Alexa. As a matter of fact once we took it out the box and plugged it in Alexa recognized it immediately.If you are having second thoughts don’t. This is a wonderful purchase and will make your life better during cooking or when multitasking in life.

  So we had high, high hopes for this small microwave.  We wanted something that would fit above our pie safe with the clearance we had between that and the ceiling.  We have many Alexa devices, and assumed this would be the perfect match.  Uhhh, no.  No, not at all.  I purchased this microwave just over a year ago, and already it is starting to quit.  It runs, sure, but the heating is terrible.  Just today I was heating a bowl of room temp soup...  And it took 5 minutes to get it kinda hot.  This is just one example of the frustrations we are having with an appliance that should provide convenience.  Anyway, if you're looking for a small microwave, and do not need Alexa to help you cook, spend a little more and get something better.  I can't return it, but I might let my son take it apart to check out the parts for a science project or something.

  Worked fine for about a year.  Started sparking and smelling like fire (you know, like if you put foil in the microwave, which we did not).  I did give it a couple more weeks, and it did not do it every time after that, but did it several times more.  Luckily this happened 16 days before the manufacturer warranty expired so I am getting a free replacement.  Not my first choice to replace it with the same one, but beats buying a new one.  I would not purchase again and from what I can tell, other reviewers had the exact same issue.  Not all were as lucky to have it break before the warranty expired.I will say, I specifically needed a small microwave for the space.  I did not want to spend a lot because I am renting a place without a microwave, and most likely won't need it when I move.  If you read reviews about it heating food unevenly, that's probably because it's a 700W not a 1000W, hence the small size.  I had no issues with it, but I was aware it was not as strong as most microwaves.The Alexa function worked, but we never used it and that is not why would we bought it.

  I purchased the microwave on Prime day, I thought the deal was pretty good they included a 3rd generation DOT at no additional cost....sweet! The microwave too longer than expected to get delivered, but that was not the issue. I took it out of the box, plugged it in and set it up with the Alexa app, things were going fine. I lost power in house during a storm and everything in my house got rebooted including my router. No damage, but now Alexa can not communicate with the Microwave at all. Alexa can see it, in the process it asks you to enter your WIFI password. I entered my password then it errors out and says ""integration failure please try again"" This went on for over an hour of trying to get it back online. As far as the microwave portion that is fine, but the Alexa integration forget it....I think you needed more QA on this one Amazon.

  I bought one of these to get us by while our wall-oven/microwave is getting fixed. I wish Amazon would send its appliance design team to help GE and others. This little microwave shows how well something cheap and simple can be designed. The time entry either in seconds or minutes is very easy and while I thought the Alexa integration was silly, I found myself using it because it was nearly flawless. A small but ""oh how nice"" feature is that the clock sets itself using the network time so it's always accurate. The wifi setup is stored in non-volatile memory so that even if you leave it disconnected, it reattaches to the network by itself in a few seconds. The microwave itself is basic and you need to add 50% of the time to adjust for the difference between 700watts and the 1000-1200watts the full-size units have.

  This is a very small microwave, however if you're like me and only use one to heat a cup of coffee or a plate of food or maybe pop a bag of popcorn, it's the perfect choice for you - even MORE so if you're into smart home products like I am.This microwave is perfect for me because I have 4 grandsons 7-11 yes old who are just old enough to start cooking some things, however they're not the cleanest creatures on the planet. So instead of touching the buttons of my microwave and leave leaving peanut butter and jelly fingerprints - or worse - they can just tell Alexa what to do!  The only thing they ever have to touch is the handle!This is also a pretty good microwave for me due to the fact that my eyesight is starting to fail and sometimes I can't read what buttons say on some microwaves.  Like I said it's a small microwave but that can be a plus as well. It's plenty big enough to hold a plate of food or things like that but not so large that it takes up all your counter space.And you can't beat the price especially for a smart home item to boot!  Oh and set up was non-existent. I plugged it in, and it already had the time set and Alexa immediately notified me that she had found it. All I had to do was open the app on my phone and choose a couple options and it was done. No searching, no headaches, no reading all the fine print in the instructions although it does come with very good instructions as well.

  I heard about this microwave just as the full sized one in my condo started going out, so I looked it up and was surprised by the price point. Set up went super quick and easy. Only snag was that it uses 2.4Ghz, 802.11 b/g/n WIFI connectivity and I had planned to put it on 5Ghz... pretty common with devices though, so I can't complain.  Overall, I really like the size of the microwave - it's perfect for people who only occasionally use one and it fits nicely in a small condo. The design is pretty sleek, and I found being able to tell Alexa to cook for however long to be convenient when hands have something on them. The features are pretty straightforward which is great - most full sized microwaves come with a ton of functions I never use. I don't ever defrost in a microwave, but I like the idea of being able to tell Alexa how much of whatever you're trying to thaw and it just happens. All in all, this is a good, fun little microwave for people not wanting to use up a lot of space.

  I initially was looking at a very pricey corner microwave when I saw this one and thought we'd try it.  No need for the corner one anymore as this one fits just fine.  We have two microwaves now on opposite ends of our kitchen.  This one is on the end with the coffee maker and Keurig.  You can fit a dinner plate of food in it, but we use it mainly for heating/reheating coffee.  Having it really helped keep traffic in the kitchen down and us coffee drinkers out of the way.  The fun part is getting the ""Alexa, heat for two minutes,"" with shutting the door a second before ending the sentence down to a T.  I really like the 30-second button too for times when I don't feel like talking.  You hit it twice and it heats for 30 seconds, keep hitting and it adds 30 seconds more.  I never bothered to learn what any of the other few buttons do as I have what I need.  Love it!

  I bought this microwave in June of 2019.  I previously posted one review about it where I reported that the glass tray spontaneously cracked in half while heating a cup of coffee for 1 minute.  Amazon was unwilling to replace the tray and I ultimately decided to buy my own replacement tray (from Amazon) because I liked that the microwave was paired with my Echo Dot.Last night, the microwave spontaneously erupted into fire.  I placed a tablespoon of butter in a small microwave safe bowl to melt for a recipe (10 seconds).  I began hearing a weird loud buzzing sound in my kitchen, but was also playing music on my Echo Dot, so took a couple seconds to figure out where the sound was coming from.  The microwave was sparking fire internally and emitting black smoke and an electrical burn odor.  I unplugged the microwave to take outside on my back porch.  When I opened the door, the tablespoon of butter was still completely cold with pieces of black ash laying in it.

I put in my oatmeal that I normally do for a minute. It took 3 minutes and my oats were crunchy! I tried to reheat just some veggies for testing purposes. I'd usually just reheat for 20-30 seconds.

  Same inside / back chassis as the MAGIC CHEF Countertop Microwave Oven 0.7 cu. ft., with an updated front, and of course that Alexa thing.  Our good old Magic Chef died after 3 years (price $39) after surviving daily use for everything from boiling water for tea, coffee warm ups, to cooking fish, breakfast sausage, bacon, frozen veggies, reheating bowls of soup, rice, whatever, etc. No gourmet meals, just everyday ""oh my stars, how did we ever survive without a microwave,"" type use.  We expect this Amazon version to last about the same mount of time.  We like the *real* handle on the door.We don't do voice activated anything (no ""clappers"", retinal scanners, or hand print activation either), so we didn't get the Echo Dot.  Basic manual use works just fine for us, thanks.  BUT... why doesn't the clock setting work manually, as instructed in the guide book???  Nope... doesn't hold the time you want to set.  It has an Alexa capability but it coughs when trying to manually set the clock?  That's not cool.  Other than that it was delivered fast, without drama, and we can reheat our coffee again! Hooray!

  As the title says, this was a great microwave for about a year. It worked with Alexa and, although low power, would reliably heat my food. The rotating tray would jump its track occasionally, but minor inconvenience.Then, today, it just started flashing inside (even with nothing in it) and charring the little metal panel on the right side of the inside. Black soot all over it. Had to open the door hastily and unplug it. I guess I need a new microwave after about a year of active use. Save your money.

  At first it worked really well. Even being able to tell Alexa time and power is actually nice. However a couple days ago I opened it and the light turned on and it started running with the door open. I closed the door and it stopped. I opened again and it turned on. I let it sit and it worked later but it no longer was connected with Alexa. We just used it as a regular microwave. Now tonight my husband put a microwave meal in it and it immediately started arcing. He took out everything (plate and the ring with wheels) except the food in microwaveable container and it was arcing again - making weird noises and light flickering on and off quickly. No sparks. We have not even paid it off because we did a few monthly payments and have only had it a couple months.

  I purchased this for our lunchroom microwave that took a dump.  This unit replaced a 900 watt Toshiba.  This new unit takes a lot longer to heat things up, especially to a boil.  A simple cup of noodles was 2 minutes, now takes three.  I haven't even tried the Alexa function.  I mean really?  How often are you going to shout out Alexa to ""Cook for 3 minutes"" after you put the cup in the oven when you can simply press ""3"" and START?The inside is pretty tight, and you can only use smaller bowls and shorter cups.It works fine for hot water, but for anything else, get a bigger, more powerful unit.It is VERY quiet except for the five beeps when finished cooking.

  This is the worlds worst microwave. Literally. Honestly a box filled with warm turds would heat up food more evenly than this. The advertised wattage puts the warming ability between “room temperature” and “my armpit” and it can’t even make it consistent across the food. It’s small, as advertised, but unlike a Toyota Corolla, it isn’t bigger on the inside. Regular bags of popcorn don’t fit, but it’s okay... because if you buy this and your wife reacts like mine did, all you’ll need is space for one of those single serve bags anyways cause she’s gonna leave your butt and you’ll be single forever. Just remember, size matters.But it talks to Alexa which is cool. Unless Alexa mistakes your dog barking for you telling the microwave to come on and it appears to be possessed by Satan or a Decepticon, in which case you’ll be replacing it sooner than me.Speaking of things it does well, if you need a fireworks display for the 4th of July, buy this in a November because 8 months is as long as it will last before it completely implodes and catches fire.1/10 would NOT buy again.

There was no reason for that to happen then so we knew the microwave was defective. Unfortunately, the time for returns or service has passed so we have a microwave that we're all, rightfully, afraid to use. It's too bad as well because it was the perfect size for three people to use to heat up drinks or breakfast up in.

  I purchased this microwave sometime in the summer last year, which means I’ve had it less than a year. During this year it’s largely gone unused because I love to cook and I’ve got 50-11 other appliances to help with that. I initially rated it 5-stars because it is cute and compact. Also, we’re asked to review things immediately after getting them, as if we’d know for real.About a month ago, it malfunctioned.  First it sparked on that right side panel once or twice while heating. I thought it was because there was something blocking the plate from rotating. No problem, just stop it for a second, adjust the box inside, and let it continue running. About a week ago it sparked really loudly while heating something small and even stopping it for a second didn’t help. I haven’t used it since. Now I have to toss an item I’ve had less than a year. I’d expect this from an outside seller, not Amazon directly. Very disappointed. Imagine if I’d put something in and walked away? Would it have exploded? Burned my home down? Scary thoughts.

  Don't bother. It wont last more that a few months before it starts trying to catch on fire. And if you purchase the peotection plan, they literally do everything they can to not replace the stupid thing. It works great at first and amazon customer service is always friendly but there are so many hoops to jump through just to prove you bought something FROM THEM. its been a very frustrating week  in regaurds to this piece of crap and its going to take at least another week before this mess is over.

  So starting from beginning, setting it up was a big hassle, did the exact same steps per instructions about 30 times and suddenly one time it just magically worked. I don't have an Echo Dot or anything, I used my Fire HD 8 tablet and so that could've contributed to it but not sure (think you have to setup it up through phone/tablet anyway?). Anyway, finally got it set up, had fun with the voice control for a bit but was not a great experience having to open up my tablet each time (on top of that Alexa drains the battery like no other app). So basically stopped using the voice control aspect.Was satisfied with the regular functionality of the microwave until I had to heat up some liquid. We had cooked some ramen and added the egg after the fact, of which it didn't cook the egg enough. Figured we could just throw it in the Microwave and heat it up for a minute but it took freaking 6-8 minutes. Most microwaves would've handled that within a minute or at most 2 minutes. Thought maybe it was a glitch that day but then a few days later we tried to reheat some soup and it took 10 minutes to heat just a small bowl of soup. Not sure what's wrong cause it heats other stuff fine. Couldn't handle it anymore so we returned it, otherwise, it would've been a perfectly fine microwave.

  this is a very small unit. way too small for a home kitchen use. the turntable keeps getting pushed off center by the weight of my coffee cup, so it's virtually useless to me.the Alexa feature-I don't quite get. you ask her to heat up a cup of coffee & she offers details on how to heat it but doesn't heat it automatically. I also find Alexa isn't that smart. Google Home & Siri are better 'companion' pieces. I know Alexa is an Amazon product so understand the feeble attempt to integrate into home kitchen.

  The start button is losing plastic after 2 weeks. The microwave heats at a minimal. If you are asked to heat at 2 minutes it will take four or more. I guess I expected more from Amazon. We bought this as a transition while we get our kitchen remodeled and it’s complete crap and a waste of your money and time. I can’t even reheat my coffee in 45 seconds. how much is Amazon making off this? Keep putting out crap products and you’ll be the last guy in line. Literally. If history tells us anything.

  I've had this microwave less than a year. It sucks ass.I use the microwave for only a few things; my tea in the morning, my kid's Jimmy Dean sandwiches, and to defrost stuff. Its primary purpose is showing me the time.  I don't use it to cook. I don't use it to make popcorn.Today I was heating up a corndog and 30 seconds in, the microwave started rumbling and smoke came out of it.It wasn't as powerful as the one I had before. In my old microwave, a cuppa tea took only three minutes. With the new one, I had to add another minute, increasing my microwave time by 25%. Then to heat up a Tina's frozen burrito, I went from a 60 second warm up time to a 90 second warm up time. That's a 50% increase in the time it takes to heat stuff up.The connection to Alexa was kinda stupid. Although I did like not having to set the clock, telling it cook times when it takes just as long (or short) to just push the buttons yourself is nothing but a cool trick.

  Four times since I've owned this it has popped loudly numerous times and showered sparks onto the food I was heating. In none of those occasions was the oven on for more than a few seconds. On none of those occasions was there any foil or metal of any sort in the oven. That's the first thing you check for. Twice I've thrown the food out because I've had no idea what may have fallen into it.  It also seems to be so low powered as to barely beat the inconvenience of using a standard stove. If it worked well it might be okay for a boat or RV with the right voltage, but even so I think you can do better and beyond that I can't recommend it at all. Mine is getting tossed.

  Product is good for small places and the Alexa integration is really cool. The reason I took off 2 stars is because it is TINY and pretty underpowered at 700w. Like you can BARELY fit a normal sized dinner plate in this thing (some brands of plates you may not actually be able to fit - mine just about touch the sides even when placed perfectly in the center), that's how small it is. Also, it takes a while to cook thicker stuff as it's only 700 watts.It's not quite what I wanted for my purposes, but if you're in desperate need of a microwave that's as small as possible (tiny apartment, college dorm, or something along those lines), then this would probably suffice. Just be aware that 700w is not much power so cook times will be much longer than what most people are used to.Again though, the Alexa integration is really neat. You need an echo in the room with it for it to work unfortunately as it doesnt have a mic/speaker built in, but it does work well. I could see this being a game changer for people with serious vision problems.

  I'll be honest, I got this microwave because I needed one and because it was about what I was willing to pay for a microwave to be used in a one-person household.Obviously there's a huge plus in purchasing this microwave if you're trying to building yourself up to a smart home with Alexa as your commander-in-chief. And yes, I said Alexa was the commander-in-chief because let's be honest... she totally wears the pants in the relationship and you're just along for the ride.In the past month, I've used Alexa with the microwave maybe 5-10 times? Not because it's not useful but because I think it's a little bit ridiculous to put something in the microwave and then tell Alexa to heat it up. It's way more efficient to just hit the button and press start since you're already there anyways. Plus, it's hard to break out of old habits! Where I see this being useful is for those with limited dexterity or other challenges that prevent them from using microwaves in the traditional manner. The skill works like a charm, I don't have any issues with it and if you're familiar with Alexa and her many commands then you'll know how to use Alexa with the microwave just fine. Not sure if you can call it a skill necessarily, but it's all the same.It's small, but again, one-person household so it's literally everything that I need. I was pleased with myself when I pulled it out of the box and it fit on this impossibly small counter area where nothing else would fit because of the amount of space available.The only thing that bothered me about this microwave was the setup process. I nearly threw the microwave out the window during the setup phase using the Alexa app. So many times the app would tell me it couldn't find the microwave despite following pairing instructions and being so close to the microwave that the phone was almost inside of it.. I eventually had to power off the microwave, phone, and modem+router to get this thing to pair properly. Outside of this though, I've had a really pleasant experience with this microwave in the past month I've had it and I would recommend the purchase to others with a reminder to take note of the size and be patience with the setup process..

  Great little microwave for heating up coffee or small meals! Alexa integration was easy and took less than a minute.

Arrived in better condition than expected and was super affordable! Now I can be a hermit at work lunchtime and avoid the gross staff microwave with it's mystery food stains. It took about 1.5 minutes to heat up a large cup of cold water. It has a removable rotating glass plate bottom for easy clean up and more even heating. The Alexa function is a fun bonus too.

  Usually microwaves last a couple years, at least two  you would think. My toshiba less than 100 bucks lasted 5 years. This tiny little mess no doubt gets all the sales for those who solely like the voice control, which is overrated. The commands aren’t user friendly.But now at just over a year after purchase we’ve got sparks. No really, any food or substance causes sparks up the side and down into the center with loud pops and smoke. At first we thought the plastic bowl had metal paint or the food was too high in iron? Like nothing makes that happens except metal. But no doubt even an ice cube in no container started sparking and throwing fire. Won’t get the same one again!

  It's a good, little, microwave, with the added bonus of Alexa integration. It is a bit under-powered compared to the over-the-range microwave I have that is no longer being manufactured but hey, I bought this knowing that and I don't regret it. I don't have any issues with microwaving some of my food a tad bit longer.I will say the microwave runs a bit loud, but once again... I'm not buying a thousand dollar microwave so... I can live with it.The convenience of Alexa is awesome. I honestly thought it would be so gimmicky since you'd have to be present at the microwave to put something in anyways, so why in the world would you want to be yelling ""Alexa, microwave for 5 minutes"" instead of just... pushing the 5 button for an express 5 minute. Well... let me tell you, it is actually rather convenient when you can just plop something in and sometimes your hands just gets messy and you don't really want to goober up the control panel. Or you have little kids who don't quite know their numbers but they're just as proficient at copying you and yelling at Alexa. Or sometimes, you just want to feel like you live in the future like the Jetsons and want to be able to control an electronic with your voice.Gimmicky? sure... convenient? also true... worth it? for its price, I think so

  So for starters let me address the good about this microwave. It’s small and compact and works well with Alexa. Sure it’s not the more powerful device, but I never minded that and was impressed at the price point considering your ability to voice control the thing with Alexa.However, there is one big drawback I have on this microwave and that’s it’s ventilation problem. Due to its lower wattage, if you have to cook something longer than about ten minutes it starts to get quite hot. At one point I stopped it and let it cool down after starting to smell electrical components. The biggest problem I have though is any time something is cooked and lets off steam your microwave ends up soaking wet on the inside. It’s quite a pain having to sit there wiping your microwave out after every use. You’d thinking venting it with the door open would held too, but it doesn’t. This thing collects condensation, and for me, the use of Alexa just isn’t worth that.So, after fighting with this microwave and it’s wetness for a few months, I finally contacted Amazon about my concern. Maybe my item was defective, or maybe just a design flaw entirely. Although they were prompt in their reply they immediately sent out a replacement and requested I send mine back upon receiving. All in all it was a nice gesture, but now more leg work for me without even giving me my options. I emailed back asking about those options in case this new microwave didn’t work and received a weirdly formatted and poorly written response that wasn’t even finished and had no signature. It stated that it would not be defective and then ended with, “If, In case the” .... that’s it, nothing after. Well, guess what amazon? I hooked this one up last night and used it this morning, once, and it’s still soaking wet inside this afternoon. While packing the other one up to send back water was actually leaking out of the microwave, down my arms, and into the box.Normally Amazon is absolutely fantastic with their customer service, but I think this microwave was poorly made and has a design flaw with its ventilation that they would rather not address since they probably have an over stock of product. That second email I received seems to have confirmed it seeing as whoever wrote it just seemed annoyed and rushed to reply without even finishing it. Maybe I can get a refund, but if not I’ll just have to get another microwave because this one does not work for my needs.

  I won't be replacing this microwave with this microwave... after 5 months I've noticed a greenish-blue fuzz growing on the ridge of the floor of the microwave, underneath the edge, but not on, the turnplate. I knew that steam would linger after use, and occasionally I'd leave the door open for a few minutes after especially steamy food, or I'd wipe down the inside walls a bit; however, that was clearly not good enough for this poorly-ventilated appliance. In fact, over half of the Amazon Brand items I've purchased have no quality behind that logo, you get what you pay for as if it were a no-name knock-off in a back alley. The only saving grace is that you can manage the moisture by babying the appliance and wiping it's wet hole multiple times a day, but I can't wait for it's functionality to crap out on me so that I can finally replace it.

  I love the alexa integration with the unit.  I bought it for my theater room where we would be popping popcorn.  At first I tried normal size bags of popcorn it it didn't perform well at all wasn't all popped because it would generally quit spinning around because the bag would catch on the side.  I then though ok I will buy the micro bags and just pop several.  That works ok just defeats the purpose of what I wanted to do with it.  I have since decided to put it in my laundry room as a second microwave to heat up something else while the main microwave is busy so I don't really get much use out of it anymore.  And could have got a much cheaper one for that purpose.  If you buying this to pop normal size popcorn get a bigger one.

  As others have mentioned, the Alexa integration works great.  However the microwave itself has not been so great: our previous microwave was a generic cheap Hamilton brand from Walmart,  and it did a surprising good job of evenly heating.  This microwave from Amazon reminds me of the microwaves from 20 years ago, you know, some spots that are hot as lava, and other spots that are still cold.  Further, the window has an older style grid shielding that makes it hard to see the food you are heating.  The only good thing is that it’s pretty quiet.Definitely regret this purchase, and it’s clear that Amazon is creating smart home appliances that sacrifice on quality.  I will begin moving away from their brand towards something more reliable.

  UPDATED REVIEW:Well ... Almost 3 years later and the handle broke off half way.  Going to try and superglue it.  But other than that it is still functioning with no other problems.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Purchased this February 2019.  So from a longevity standpoint I can definitely write in a review that is is a well made microwave that has ""lived"" almost 1.5 years already.Yes ... it is small, but if you read the description and utilize the given measurements before you purchase this microwave, you will know it is small before it ever hits your doorstep.We were pretty anti microwave for so long, but decided to purchase this small one for reheating coffee, melting butter, etc.  We have a 1200 sq foot house with a tiny kitchen and our sits on a some extra shelfs and is perfect in size.Have never found any problem in heating.  Easy to use, really have never had a complaint with it in all the time we have owned it.Does it work with Alexa?  Now that I cannot tell you.  We use Apple HomeKit. Plus, I figure, unless Alexa can pick up my coffee, stick it in the microwave and automatically heat it, and then bring it to me, I am just not wanting to jump on board digitally to all that.Overall, no regrets on our purchase.

  So I was sooooo excited to get this microwave. Alexa has been integrated into our whole household and I thought this would be sooo cool. Well the day the microwave came I was kind of shocked about the size of the microwave at first glance. But that's kind of what we were going for as we were downsizing from the giant microwave we had. We didn't think it would be this small but meh it was fine as it still fit most things we needed to microwave. The first thing we popped was popcorn and it worked pretty well. We were optimistic at that point. Well it all went downhill from there. We went to microwave some left over lasagna and it took 4.5 minutes to cook a small piece of left over lasagna.. Which I thought ok we've only had it a couple days, I'll  give it another shot. Next my fiance tried to microwave a left over burger from the other nights dinner and it literally TOOK 6 MINUTES!!! 6 MINUTES!!! How you gonna take 6 minutes to warm up a small burger? Crazy!!! The kicker finally was tonight I needed to defrost some chicken and put it on 50 percent power, set weight defrost and it literally cooked the edges of the chicken but the middle was completely frozen.. Welp can't have chicken parm now cuz the chicken is basically ruined... This is one of the very few products of Amazon's that I have been unhappy with and I'm pretty bummed that it doesn't work the way we expected it too. I know it's only 700 watts but still shouldn't take 6 minutes to cook a burger. I'm hoping to return this thing for a full refund as its just not up to the standard we expect from Amazon.

  Well, where to start...Pros:-It truly is small and would be great if you dont use large plates or bowls and have a small amount of counter space. That is about all I can think of.Cons:-Well, it advertises that you can use Alexa to set the time on the microwave. Which, I have only gotten it to work ONCE out of the hundred of times I have pressed that button.-it heats so unevenly, which is to be expected out of a microwave but it is pretty darn bad.-It somehow caught my microwave safe container, that has never been a problem, on fire. I put it in with food for only 2 mins. I checked on it around 1:35 because I smelled something weird and noticed a tiny flame and smoke coming from the microwave.

  I needed a replacement microwave immediately & this arrived 2 days after I ordered it. The old one (an RCA brand 1000 watt) rusted beyond safe use in less than 2 years after getting it new. This time I'm trying an Amazon Basics brand product & hopefully less will be more as even though it is 700 watts & not 1000 & I removed the use of the roller wheels ( take my advice & never use those - they cause rusting on the interior floor of the microwave oven) this time, hopefully I won't need another microwave again for at least 5 years. Though I would've preferred a 1000 watt oven, this will have to do as $60 was what I had to work with for a microwave. I refuse to activate Alexa on this, as Its really not necessary.

  UPDATE (08/19/21): The paint is peeling away inside the microwave cavity after a couple of years of standard use a few times a week. I have never had that happen with a microwave in my life but wanted to make mention of it with this unit so that prospective buyers understand the quality issues with these ""amazon basics"" products. I've had Amazon Basics cables fail, Amazon Basics batteries burst, and now this Amazon Basics microwave has peeling paint across the bottom and top surfaces in the cooking cavity itself. Buyer beware.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Fairly average product and you get what you pay for with this. It’s not the worst but it’s far from a perfect product. The setup is a little odd in that you absolutely have to have the Alexa app to get it through the setup process and there are lost connections often while trying to get it all to connect. Once it’s setup, the microwave is fairly straightforward in operation. It’s a bit small but works for most things, it’s not the most powerful but definitely gets the job done. The upside of it being a little underpowered is that it isn’t as loud as many other standard units which is a welcome feature. The buttons don’t operate as smooth as other units but again you get what you pay for with this unit and for a relatively inexpensive microwave with a small counter footprint that is used for heating up small amounts of food or leftovers, this seems like a decent pick among others in this price range.

That is my only complaint about the microwave.I have a tiny apartment and use my microwave for heating up the odd frozen dinner or a cup of hot water or reheating coffee or defrosting chicken.The price was perfect the size ideal and it is an Amazon Basic product meaning you get exactly what is advertised.The fact that it could be voice controlled did not enter into my buying decision.That being said I have found it far more convenient than I could have imagined to have it connected to my dot and to tell Alexa ""Reheat 1 cup of coffee"" while I prepare my breakfast or chop an onion or wash my hands.To be fair apart from the very poor advice regarding controlling your microwave with your firestick - this microwave is perfect.

  The microwave lasted only a little over a year. We bought it for the Alexa features, but never really used it. It was easier and faster to do all the commands yourself by punching in the minutes of cook time. These microwaves are not made to last. Ours literally blew up after just a little over a year. Not a microwave I would recommend until Amazon can perfect the product.

  Update, we nearly 3yrs into using this microwave multiples times/daily basis and it's still working well (buttons are a little worn as expected).  The only negative is the realization that one should not get a microwave weaker than 900W for regular home use.  This 700W microwave is really best for student/dorm use to heat up snacks or make popcorn.  Compared to a 900W microwave, things take a minute or longer to cook/boil etc. in a 700W for us.  We are finally going to change back to a 900W next week.  Just wish Amazon also makes this in a 900W option!Original review - If you don't count the Echo dot as a smart appliance, this Amazon Basics Microwave is our first smart appliance.First important thing to know is that this microwave is VERY SMALL (I posted two pics to show its size) - perfect to have if you live in the dorm or live alone (or have a super small kitchen with hardly any counter space).  0.7cu.ft. is very small - the inside cooking space is 10.5"" across, 10"" deep, and 7"" high.  You can't properly cook a chicken in this.  But since we do little more than warm up food/drinks, hardly cooking for more than 2.5 minutes at a time, this is fine.  For a family of four that will do some real cooking, this microwave would be inadequate.Initial frustration was the Alexa set up - following the simple directions (press 2 on the microwave, heard a beep, proceed to connect in the Alexa app), the Alexa app repeatedly failed to detect the microwave (I tried on both my Android and iOS/Apple phone)!  Finally, I unplugged the microwave, restarted my iPhone, and tried again - I guess that did the trick and the Alexa app detected the microwave!The reason I'm not giving this a 5 stars review is that the door and door plastic hinges/hooks don't seem very sturdy - I HOPE they will last +3yrs.  Also, the round glass dish inside the microwave could be a little thicker/more sturdy.  Given the small size, I wish Amazon sold a larger size for their AmazonBasics brand microwave - a 1.0 cu.ft with 1000watts power rating would be perfect!However, having an Alexa enabled microwave is GREAT - I just tried it, touched the round blue button on the microwave and said ""45 seconds"", and then the microwave started up and the Echo dot simply said ""microwave 45 seconds power 10.""  You don't need to touch the blue button to tell it what to do, you can simple say ""Alexa microwave for 1 minute."" if there's an Echo dot nearby.  Sweet!  I'm not going back to old school microwaving - having to look at and fumble with buttons, sometimes pressing the wrong time and having to do it again ;/

  You know, the main reason I originally purchased this was because it was one of the cheapest Microwaves Amazon had, and we needed a temporary one.  I thought the voice integration with Alexa would be interesting, but it wasn't a selling point.  I have to admit, I really like the concept now.  It occurred to me that someone with vision impairment could really benefit from the voice integration.  My 2 gripes aren't big ones.  The first is that they only have the small one.  And it is quite small.  If you need a small microwave, then obviously that becomes a bonus, but being small it also doesn't have alot of wattage.  So it's going to take longer to heat/cook things.  The 2nd is that the Alexa integration is still pretty limited.  I'd really like to see more items that it knows how to cook.  With microwaves it's always a bit of a guessing game because wattages are so different with microwaves.  The more items Alexa knows how to microwave, the better it will work for users as Amazon will be able to know based on wattage what the correct amount of time should be.  Anyway, I really think this could be the future of microwaves, and I really hope more companies go down this route.

  i haven't owned a microwave in years, but due to the pandemic i thought it would be a good idea to easily heat up meals. i have a lot of experience using microwaves in the past, as well as recently at work.this microwave is not intuitive to use whatsoever. i did not buy it intending to set up alexa integration, it was just the most affordable basic microwave available. to use it out of the box without alexa, you have to plug it in and wait for the bluetooth pairing to fail. if you want to use it as a regular microwave you have to hold down 7 and 9 for a while.by far the worst part is that the microwave just sucks. it takes 5-6 minutes for me to heat up a piece of frittata every day. the power level is on 10. this should take 2 minutes, 3 tops. don't buy this thing.update: the light stopped working. i think this is the worst product i have ever purchased.update #2 (7/29/20): Amazon replaced my microwave in order to fix the light. Since this is the second one I've tested now, I can confirm with more certainty that it is terrible. Imagine your normal, good microwave is just set to 40% power permanently. I just heated up a piece of frittata for lunch. First I cooked for 2 minutes. Then an additional 1:30. Then an additional 1 minute. Nearly 5 minutes to heat up some eggs to warm enough to eat.

  It is a small microwave, and on the weaker side with regards to power. That said, many if not most instructions will give you the times for different wattage micros, and the 600watt time instructions give the best results.Heating is generally even and I've had no problems with normal microwave functionality.I do not use this as my main microwave (a large powerful nuclear beast in the kitchen), I have the Amazon micro in my room upstairs, which I use to heat up leftovers, reheat coffee, or bag popcorns, and it has done fine. I really like that I don't have to worry about resetting the time after power outages (the time is updated automatically via wifi with Echo) and the voice activation is fun.Where it has failed for me is some issue with connectivity. Randomly some time between a week and two weeks it will cease to respond to voice prompts. Alexa will just say ""Sorry, Microwave is not responding."" and you have to delete the microwave from the Alexa profile, unplug the unit and do the set up from scratch. Process doesn't take long, but is quite annoying.When it loses connectivity like this and you have to reset, the popcorn re-order is also disconnected so that feature is a loss for me as well.All said, I do like the microwave, but periodically having to redo set up is getting old, and I'll probably soon just give up on the novelty of its voice activation

  The weakest microwave I've ever used. Count on adding 30-90 seconds to whatever you're used to in a standard microwave.Alexa integration works well enough, but in the year since I've owned this microwave, I still haven't found a use for the Alexa integration other than having the clock automatically sync.This really just isn't something that needs to be ""smart"" -- it's always 100% faster to hit the physical buttons than to ask Alexa to start the microwave, especially since you will be standing in front of it when you put something in it anyway.Overall, I would not recommend this. It has held up well over the past year, but it's performance has been consistently underwhelming. It's worth even spending a little extra for a reliable microwave with a normal power level, without the unnecessary bells and whistles.

  I bought this microwave from Amazon, after I couldn't find a cheap option in stock at Fred Meyer, since I could buy it on a payment plan and it seemed to have decent reviews. I didn't buy it for the Alexa option, and don't plan on utilizing that feature in the future. It works well, is on the smaller side, and seems to be designed well enough for a bachelor's utility. I have to add a little time for most thing I ""cook"" since it has lower wattage, but that doesn't bother me.The only regret I have with this purchase is I could have paid $10 more for an entirely similar unit that had an option to silence the key-press beep noise that microwaves make. I'm up at 4:30am on weekdays for work, and I do the absolute best I can to keep quiet, as I prepare for the day, for the sake and sanity of my apartment-dwelling neighbors. The key-press beep function is contradictory to this goal, and I generally find the beeping noises made by microwaves to be generally annoying. I don't know if Amazon has the ability to update the firmware on these models since the Alexa feature is included, but I wish I hadn't overlooked the beep-canceling feature of the slightly more expensive product when making this purchase. Other than that, I'm happy with this microwave.

  Love the thing! The Alexa functionality is what sold me.  I knew it was smaller (it doesn’t even work with a normal sized bag of popcorn) but I really wanted to be able to turn it on with Alexa.  Who would have known that instead of being just a fun thing it would also be super functional.  There are functions that I typically just don’t use on a microwave because I don’t read the dang manual and don’t know how they work.  Well now I can defrost, cook a potato to perfection, turn on the microwave to warm something up from upstairs (if I placed the item in there within the 10 minute window). Oh, I wanted to mention the 10 minute window.  My kid can’t mess with it because it only works with Alexa if the microwave door was opened within 10 mins.  Perfect!!

  As far as microwaves go, it is perfectly fine, but I have more capability with most of my third-party add-ons to Alexa than I do with this microwave from the producers of Alexa.  What does it do? Pretty much nothing but give you a button to press so that you don't have to say ""Alexa"" before give voice command to cook (which requires an Echo device in listening distance to the microwave, which by now you are fully accustomed to saying the wake word, so pushing a button to save one word is a step backwards).Without the echo, you have nothing and are limited to button control just like a traditional microwave.Unfortunately, adding an Echo doesn't bring you anything more than voice control that only lasts for 10-minutes from the last time you open the microwave door.What should an Alexa integrated microwave be able to do?1. Allow an override of the 10-minute timer. If you can figure out how to safely start my car and unlock my doors, I'm sure there is an acceptable option that will allow me to start the microwave after 10 minutes. I have read many arguments for voice control on microwave as positive for the disabled, but with your 10 minute timeout, that person who has disabilities that would warrant voice control (possibly limited mobility) now has to go to microwave and reopen and close the door in order to restart voice capability, and then stand around (which may be difficult) and wait for the microwave heating to end. Or even in a more mainstream scenario, my wife forgets her coffee in the microwave for more than 10 minutes (happens all the time). A ""smart"" integration would let me tell the Echo downstairs to reheat the coffee so that when I got upstairs it would be ready for me to pull out of the microwave, instead of having to wait for the full reheat time. Isn't the idea of a smart home to use cool technology to gain silly efficiencies?2. Put an alert that tells you when your microwave is done cooking. I was amazed that this simple integration wasn't there. My washer and dryer tell me when their done, my doors tell me when their open, my car tells me when it starts, but my Alexa Microwave doesn't tell me when it's done cooking?3. Allow me to set a timer. i.e. I can put a boil-a-bag rice in the micro in the morning, and start it in the afternoon before I get home for lunch.And that's just the BASIC stuff I thought I would be able to do with this microwave but sadly found out that except during a 10-minute window, I have a dumb microwave, and even during that 10-minute period, I get only the slightest integration with Alexa.

  The microwave is small and fits easily in a tiny apartment, like mine, but at 700 Watts, it does a poor job actually microwaving. It usually takes double the time to heat anything up. It also heats up unevenly. I’ve attempted to microwave for longer times at a lower power level, ensure the microwave is venting properly, and other troubleshooting tips to no avail. The microwave is good if your main goal is to have a virtual assistance push buttons for you, but that’s about it.

  I picked this up at woot.com as a refurb to replace a Sunbeam SBM7500 600watt microwave. It came without a manual, and after two hours, I consulted the help page on Amazon, where I learned it had to have 8"" of space between walls and at least 12"" overhead, so I set it up on my living room floor, and it was simple and easy.This is a win-win over my previous microwave, it's more powerful, and an inch smaller in every direction. The space saved allowed me to reorient the oven so that it faced outwards, I didn't have to move the coffeemaker to open the door, I also don't have a keypad or knobs to clean, anymore, and in many cases I don't have to guess how many minutes it will take to cook or warm something. I only will have to clean out the interior if someone is careless.I rarely microwave anything, which is part of the reason why I still had a 16 year old Sunbeam. I just use the microwave to melt butter, heat croissants, or occasionally cook a breakfast bowl with eggs and bacon or sausage. I cook on a stovetop for everything else -But I am pleased with this so far.

  Just received an Echo for Christmas and decided to get the Amazon Microwave to replace a standard one with the same exact measurements.  In regards to the microwave itself -It can function just the same as a regular one if you want. Or you can call out to Alexa to Microwave for however long you want. But keep in mind you must be in ear shot distance from your Alexa in order to turn on the Microwave on in order for it to start with out pressing buttons. There are also presets that Alexa knows like ""Alexa microwave 2.4 oz popcorn"". She knows a bunch more but I would tend to repeat myself until she understood the instructions. She is best used for defrosting items. If you don't want to say Alexa microwave....every time. There is an Alexa button on the MW that you can press once and just say the cooking time and nothing else. But you still need to be in ear shot of your Alexa.  I think on future models they need to put a microphone in the microwave so you don't need to scream out to wherever your echo is located at every time.  I like the microwave as it is super simple and does not take a whole lot of counter space. I still find my self pressing buttons at this point but I think it is because it is more out of habit.

  Our over-the-range microwave died so we bought this to use while we got another one. It lasted for almost two years, but now is sparking and zapping all of a sudden so we're tossing it. We loved the Alexa part of it, and it was great for our little kids who could tell her to ""microwave the popcorn for two and half minutes"" instead of punching in the buttons. The thing I did not like, is that it was small and did not vent well. When you cooked things like popcorn or soup or bacon, the entire inside steams up and requires learning - even when using a cover.It would have been nicer if it had lasted longer but I guess for $60 it's not too bad.

  First of all this thing is SMALL. You can't even fit a standard microwave popcorn packet in it, just the snack size.Secondly, 700 watts is the equivalent of an Easy Bake Oven. It takes at least 10 minutes to heat a frozen dinner, and double the time stated for a breakfast sandwich.

  We selected this because it came with a free 3rd gen dot for less than its current price. We gave up trying to use Alexa after the first 2 months. It just would not remain connected. It's a cute gimmick but you can't add time without opening the door to reset it. It decided to catch fire today, 18 months after purchase. There is no damage on the plate and from other reviews, it's a common issue.

I have a medium/large kitchen and it is acceptable, but don't buy this appliance unless you are interested in the Alexa integration.  which is quite good.You can say, ""Alexa, microwave for 35 seconds"", but I find that just hitting the Alexa button on the microwave (your hand will be right there when you close the door) and saying, ""35 seconds"" to be a lot easier and more likely to give you the desired results.9 out of 10 times, it does exactly what you want it to.  When it works, it is magical and a time savor.  I scoffed at the idea that this would make my life easier, but it rather nice to be able to walk away from the microwave and on to the next task while setting the cooking time.  Much like the first time I asked my phone to call someone or I paid for something with my phone, this feels like living in the future.1 out of 10 times it doesn't work and starts cooking for 5 seconds instead of 35 seconds.  This forces you start over or cancel and think, ""Man, I should have just done this manually, it would have been faster.""  Much like asking my phone to call someone and watching in horror as it calls my ex instead or having Google Pay fail at the checkout line, it can be frustrating every now and again.If you already have an Alexa device in your kitchen and use it on a regular basis, this is a cool appliance.  I needed a microwave and was willing to try something a little different.  I am glad that I did.  However, I do not believe that replacing a perfectly good microwave with this is worth it just for the Alexa integration.

  With my last microwave oven if I chose 50% power for one minute it operated at 50% for one minute.  With this Amazon Basics model it runs on 100% power half the time.  Set the timer for one minute and it cycles on for about 15 seconds, then off for 15 seconds, on again for another 15 seconds and so on.  If you're cooking something delicate that you never want nuked at 100% you don't want this model.Whenever I buy something it's with the intention of using it until it breaks.  Since I'm not happy with this purchase and don't want the hassle of returning it I intend to hold onto it for a few months until I can research a more suitable model and then donate this one to charity.

  If you've ever been near an electric line transformer when it is about to explode, you'd recognize the sound and bright flashes which followed when I tried to heat up something for 15 seconds earlier today.  Nothing metal inside, but to be sure I took everything out and tried to run it again.  Same thing - very loud buzzing and flashing followed by widespread panic throughout the household.  The noise was too loud to allow me to calmly ask Alexa to please stop the microwave from trying to catch itself on fire.  I'm grateful that I was able to reach over the unit to unplug it without being injured and I'll make a note to not put the fire extinguisher next to my next microwave.Over all, I appreciate the small size, the low watts, being able to run it from Alexa, I love everything about the product other than the lingering fear of an electrical explosion and resulting fire.

  My husband and I received this microwave as a wedding gift along with the echo dot and it has been a well used item in our house since. It is easy to use just plug it in and then connect it to your echo dot on your Alexa app and start using it. The microwave itself is very small but it does say how big it is when you order it so I cant take any rating off for that. The reason I do not give this 5 stars is because the Alexa button on the microwave only works sometimes but it always works with the echo dot!You can use this microwave like any normal one just pick a time and go but being able to voice activate is really helpful when juggling multiple things in your hands. I also love the minute feature it will go up to 9 mins by just pressing the single button ex 9 will show 9 mins. Most microwaves I have used stop at 6 so I really love this feature. This microwave is smaller and a lower wattage so stuff does take longer to heat up than it shows on most packaging so please be aware of that. Overall, we would definitely recommend this to the smart house lover!

  The microwave works for a few months, but if it runs for more than a few minutes straight it makes a loud buzzing and shocks come out of the inner right side and a flame about 1-2 inches starts setting the microwave on fire.  This has happened to others if you look at reviews.  Amazon replaced mine but made sure to tell me it was only replaced since I have been a member for 11 years and not because they wanted to fix their faulty and dangerous microwave.

  Alexa gives me trouble from time to time to use to control the microwave.  I purchased this November 2019 and don't use it heavily so unfortunately, I'm disappointed that the inside paint is already peeling.  I wish I knew the quality of the cosmetic materials used to paint the inside metal.  It's not good quality.  I've owned many microwaves and never had the paint peel or chip at all.  That's the biggest flaw.  It's not meant for a household of more than one, I believe.  It's good for a single person, a dorm room or studio size.  You have to add double cooking time because it's not as powerful as I thought it would be.  The design outside is beautiful.  It is easy to use and when Alexa works to control it, it's awesome.

  In less than four months, after very frequent cleanings of both the tray and the interiour surfaces, there is a horrible stink that I cannot get rid of. I think it is due to the considerable condensation that this thing produces it. I always cover my food.

  Started arcing this morning inside the right control area - not within the cooking compartment. Some smoke came out but it hasn't shut down yet. Cooks poorly and the arcing is quite extreme and probably dangerous. Also the coating on the bottom of the cooking cavity is bubbling up and exposing bare metal. Before this I've had it shut down (no lights) after 10 minutes of continuous usage - maybe a cooling fan inside died?

  I needed to replace a secondary microwave in my kitchen so I chose this one. Setup and pairing with an Echo was easy - with a generation 2 Dot it worked perfectly.  However when I replaced my Gen 2 with a generation 3 Dot, I discovered that the Alexa button on the microwave did not trigger the Generation 3 Dot. Voice commands given to the gen 3 Dot for the microwave starting with the trigger word work fine. After resetting both the microwave and the gen 3 Dot twice and reconnecting, the Alexa button remained inactive. So I reached out to Amazon for help to solve the Alexa button failure. Of course they had me reset both the microwave and the gen 3 Dot and reconnect during our conversation - which as when I did it didn't solve the problem. After way too much time spent with no solution I finally had to stop the 'help' session. The microwave is great otherwise, but it's not as convenient without the Alexa button direct access.

  So I just came to see what wattage the microwave is but figured I’d leave a review because I’ve had this for about 8 months and it has served me so well. It’s a lower wattage so for microwaveable foods sometimes you have to add a little extra time but honestly it’s a great microwave and so small! Seriously! I live in a 350 Sq ft studio and didn’t think I’d find anything that would fit on my counter but this does! I assumed a small microwave would be crappy at cooking evenly but this one isn’t at all! I’m really happy with it. (And seriously i microwave everything..  like.. even stuff that probably shouldn’t be microwaved 😹 kidding ) I also just crammed a large heating pad folded up into it and it worked- woo!One disclaimer!! When using it (and this is pretty much true of any microwave but I’ve noticed it happen especially fast With this one) make sure everything is rotating freely or it will burn the part that’s stuck. My boyfriend stacked pizza slices and one part kept the tray from rotating and started to burn. My smoke detector is super sensitive (and small apartment) because there was literally no smoke, just a burned smell. But that’s true of all microwaves so besides that it’s awesome.Also seriously- so tiny. I took a picture. Please don’t judge my stack of dishes 😹 for the size and the price- totally worth it. I haven’t used the Alexa feature much but the few times I have its been helpful when guessing what amount of time would be right.

  I got this to replace my old dirty microwave. You can literally get the same size at a local store for the same price without the Alexa integration! So getting that extra feature is an absolute bonus. For those who are not familiar with Alexa or smart home gadgets, here are some things you should know.1. You need to have an Alexa app on your phone2. Obviously, wifi is needed but not for basic microwave operations3. You will need an echo device to control this using a wake word. Without it, you need to press the Alexa button on the microwave itself. I haven't tried using it without an echo but I believe there are a lot of videos out there that may demonstrate that. This also means, this is not an echo device so the Alexa button only controls this device.4. If you forget to take your food out then try to reheat it again, Alexa will tell you that the microwave door hasn't been active for a while so you will need to open and close the door again.5. This is a small microwave, typically what you use in a dorm room. It fits a regular sized plate, nothing larger.Overall, this is a simple microwave. The Alexa integration is a feature but it's more of a gimmick or a way to show off with your friends and family. Of course, that's how it applies to me.  This could be quite useful for the sight impaired or if you just have dirty hands to press on the buttons or if you can't figure out the manual controls of your microwave. So whether you want to use voice control or just push buttons, this will get the small heating/ cooking jobs done!

  I received this microwave and immediately wanted to hook it up to test out the Alexa functions.  It was really easy to connect with just a few clicks on my phone.  However, after issuing a few commands (while texting friends to tell them about my fun new toy) I realized that the outside of the microwave was really hot... so hot i couldn't put my hand on it.I reached out to Amazon customer service who immediately issued a refund for the product.  I wanted an Alexa microwave, but didn't reorder since I saw several reviews where people said it overheated or even started on fire.  I was willing to wait until they figured out the problem.  Because of that, I went to Walmart and picked up a similar small microwave.  When I tested that microwave it also got really hot on the outside.At this point I went to the internet to see if that's normal.  Maybe I just never noticed it on my old microwaves?  As it turns out, you're not supposed to run microwaves while they're empty.  Turns out this was the entire issue!  Once I put a cup of water in the Alexa microwave and gave the same commands, the outside remained an entirely normal temp.I wanted to write this review since it's possible that this is the reason for so many negative reviews on the product.  When you get a new Alexa enabled toy you immediately want to test it...even if you aren't ready to eat at that moment.Amazon, as you read this review, please feel free to recharge my card for the microwave.  It was sitting in a trash pile when I spoke to you but now it's back on my kitchen counter.  It's only been a few hours, but so far so good.  However, on that note, you may want to add to the user manual that people should not be running the microwave empty.As for everything else, yes, this is a small microwave.  If you're concerned about size just go to the store and look at .7 cubic foot microwaves.  It's exactly as described and great for small spaces.The Alexa commands I've tried seem to be great at estimating the time needed for things.  Is voice command necessary?  No.  Is it fun?  Yes!

  I am writing this brief review for readers who wonder whether Alexa is needed to operate this microwave.  The answer is an emphatic no.  My wife couldn't be bothered with Alexa.  When the microwave arrived, she took it out of the box, cleaned it, quickly set it on the counter top, plugged it in, and began using it, without Alexa.  Could not be faster or easier to set-up and use.  Yes, there are instructions, but few are needed for anyone who already owns a microwave.  How is it working?  Great so far.  It is much quieter than the microwave it replaced.  How will it hold up over time?  Don't know, but this microwave is so inexpensive that I am not worried about it lasting a long time.Bottom line: This microwave is fast and easy to set-up and use and does not need Alexa.  So far, it works well.  Recommended.

  We had this for under a year and used it a normal amount.  The small size was great but the Alexa integration stopped working within the first month.  That is fine because the buttons still work but we used it last week to make instant oatmeal (was on for ~2 minutes) and it caught fire on the inside, melted a big bubble in the plastic on the side and melted the metal panel on the inside as well so it just crumbled on the inside.

  As a Senior with little tech savy, I was surprised that this product was geared to Alexa.  I have no need for Alexa.

The big issue for me is with frozen dinners.  It doesn't defrost and cook at once.  The dinner has to be defrosted, then started again to cook.

  The AmazonBasics line has another winner with the budget-friendly, compact microwave that easily earns 4.5 stars!It doesn't need much counter space, but it still has a good amount of room on the inside for heating up food. It comes with a turntable plate, and it syncs up easily to Alexa. As someone who suffers from chronic hand pain due to fibromyalgia, I love being able to ask Alexa to turn it on. You can even tell her complicated formulas such as ""Alexa, turn the microwave on for 5 minutes at power 10, followed by 5 minutes at power 5.""Things to Know:At 700W, you're going to need to adjust your cooking times. For example, Kraft Easy Mac recommends 3.5 minutes, but 4 minutes is perfect with this microwave. That's not a flaw in the design - it's the way 700W microwaves work. They're simply less powerful than other microwaves, but they're also much more affordable.Unlike some other microwaves, this one doesn't beep a million times. Its beep is a bit softer too (thank you, Amazon!), and it stops the second you open the door. This feature alone makes me love this microwave.My only serious complaint (and the reason I gave this a 4-4.5 star average) is that condensation quickly accumulates on the bottom of the microwave. You'll need to wipe off the turntable plate frequently, especially if you're going to put something in the unit such as a microwaveable heat wrap. Otherwise, the bottom of whatever you place in the microwave will get wet.Despite that quibble, I definitely recommend this to people who want a good, inexpensive microwave.

  I purchased this in November 2018.  The Alexa feature stopped working after approximately six months.  I tried resetting the microwave, and reinstalling it on my phone app, all to no effect.  I decided I could live with the issue.  What I cannot live with is the arcing and flame that randomly started shooting out of the side panel about two weeks ago.  Sometimes it works fine, other times, not so much due to these very disconcerting flames.  Some reviewers have suggested popcorn is the problem, I never used it for that as I loathe microwaved popcorn.  I ordered early on, so perhaps I received a unit with questionable quality control.

  For the life of me I tried and tried,..but could not connect this microwave to Echo. Like the other 1-star reviewers, I followed the instructions but the microwave would not show under devices.  I wrote an angry review though I decided to keep the device, which worked fine except for the main reason I bought it.Amazon responded by email with further instructions, inviting me to leave my phone number and good times for them to call me if I was willing to talk.

  I love the Alexa assisted cooking by product and weight, and  The child lock feature.  The “reheat”  setting makes cold food just right— Not too hot to eat.Some reviews seem frustrated with cooking. It’s only 700 watts so you have to adjust cooking time suggestions.  Roast recipes and prepared foods are written for 1100 to 1200 W microwaves.

  I’m an elderly widower who lives alone and has trouble reading the fine print on the buttons and symbols on the front of a conventional microwave.  Now I just ask Alexa to work it all out for me.  Nice lady, that Alexa.  And smart too.  She even resets the time automatically after the power goes out.  One thing I don’t understand is why some folks are complaining that the unit is smaller than they expected.  The size and power are clearly stated on Amazon.  Maybe when they get older and wiser they will start noticing things like that before they order something.

  I purchased this microwave because of it's size, it is nice and small.  I do not have an Alexa device so could never change the clock setting to my time zone, but that is a minor issue. The main concern is that it started sparking, making loud popping noises and smoking during use (no, I didn't put metal in it). I know appliances don't last long, but expected more than 18 months.

  The Alexa integration is very useful, though there have been some disappointments.  Doing a baked potato the instruction say to turn over halfway, I expected that Alexa would pause the cooking so I could do that.  It seemed like that would be an obvious function in a preprogrammed ""Alexa, microwave 1 potato"" command.I'm also finding that I'm leaving the microwave door open a lot as it's always so full of steam and moisture.Finally, the plastic over the buttons is already starting to become rough and bubbled on the buttons I press most often, and I've had it only for about a month.Minor gripes, just wish I could add my own recipes ""Alexa make tea"" she immediately asks how long, (3 minutes in 8oz water) but she doesn't remember it for next time.After several months I'm finding the microwave getting very dirty under the rotating glass platform.

  This microwave sucks and I regret buying. It does a terrible job heating up food. My food comes out lukewarm and cold in some spots. Even when I increase the time to five minutes.

  Bought this as a Prime day deal for my college dorm. I thought this would be too small or that it would be too flimsy considering it was so cheap. Nope! I've seen many microwaves on display at Walmart or Target that are similarly priced but you can't even open the door without pulling the whole microwave with it. They looked like they were cheaply made and awful. This microwave is not like that. It looks pretty well made, and high end. Alexa integration is great. Sure, it's easier to just press the button to start the microwave. But sometimes, you're in the other room and want to stop the microwave so rather than run to the kitchen, all you have to do is tell Alexa to stop. As a tech nerd, this microwave is a dream. Highly recommend. There's plenty of space for a fairly large plate. But you won't be cooking much bigger than that in this. Heating seems okay from what I've tried but I've only tested it a fair amount before returning it to its box preparing to move it into a dorm. Overall, great microwave!

  It's definitely not a microwave for everybody. It's the least used cooking appliance in my apartment, basically used for things that must be done in a microwave and that's it.Pros:- Very small profile. So small, I can barely fit things on top of it like I used to do on my much larger microwave.- Alexa integration works well, if a little unintuitive since you need another device that has a mic to use it.Cons:- Very very weak microwave. If you're cooking anything under 4 or 5 minutes, just add an extra minute to give the microwave time to warm up.- The door has to be pulled open, which always feels like I'm pulling too hard to get it open.

  I’m giving it one extra star for the convenience of Alexa integration but the microwave if faulty. I’ve had time to test this since purchase. For warming food (less than 1 min.) it works fine. Makes popcorn in slightly less time than my last small microwave.I’ve tried a longer cook (20 min in my last 700w microwave). It took 39 minutes in this microwave and still had cold spots. It will shut off the magnetron after 40 seconds and rest for 5 seconds repeating this cycle indefinitely even after shut down and restart.Gets super hot. Could be overheating? I can only feel safe using it for very short periods. Even after cooling off it will immediately get hot and turn itself off every 40 seconds ( yes I verified that it was at power 10). It takes way too long and gets way too hot.

  This microwave is a well made, basic, low watt microwave with a small footprint. The major feature is being able to tell your Amazon Echo how long to cook and what to cook using presets. It's great and has some unexpected uses besides the coolness factor. For example, sometimes I'll reheat a cup of coffee while working at home and forget about it. The Echo alarm in my room lets me know the microwave is done. If I forget about it, I can just say ""Alexa, reheat for 1 minute"" and it goes. Verbal confirmation from the Echo is a great feature. It also has a safety feature: It won't run if the door hasn't been opened before giving a command. So don't worry about your kids or your TV accidentally setting the microwave to run for 30 minutes.The only disadvantage is the microwave is 700 watts, which might not be what you are used to in a high-end microwave but it gets the job done. It's worked perfectly on everything I've made.

  Pro’s - good size to fit on a counter in small spaces.Cons - size is a little too small. Ex - you cant stand up a bag of heat up pasta or rice.  Not a huge deal, but sometimes can make a mess.  The heat distribution us terrible.  It holds In moisture after heating an item and builds up mold and bacteria all over. It gets an awful smell. It’s quite disgusting and disturbing.  You need to clean it and wipe down every day to keep that issue at bay and leave the door open to let the moisture out. I’ve never dealt with this with any other microwave.For the “luxury” of telling the microwave to turn on (I honestly don’t even use that feature)  it is not worth it at all.

  I have a really small space for a microwave, so I'm limited in what I can buy. This fit the space but wasn't great right from the start. It heated unevenly and I couldn't get the Alexa integration to work. That was OK because I decided I didn't want my microwave to be listening in on me anyway. The real problem with the microwave is that after only a scant year and a half of use (past the warranty window, of course), it started fizzing and catching fire. Yikes! My last microwave lasted several years, so I'm shocked at how quickly and dramatically this one died. I'll buy a different brand to replace it.

  Our preteen daughter is blind. We thought this would be great for her. It is and isn't. It works great with Alexa and set up was a breeze. But it is small. Tiny even. Anyone else shop at Costco? Do you love the $10.00 deli pizza? Well you can not put 2 pieces on a paper plate to reheat in this microwave . It will not let them rotate. We have large soup bowls. Dinner plate size with raised edges. You can not get your hands on the side of the hot bowl to lift it out. You have to remember she is blind. It is hard lifting and moving things normally.

  I got this for my 96 YO, low vision mother. It had become hard, and dangerous,  for her to get hot food and drinks out of her over the range microwave and she can't read the buttons on it so everything is done by feel. She already had an Alexa Dot. This one doesn't take up much room on her counter but it's plenty big enough for her needs. An unexpected benefit is that the door opens by simply pulling on the handle, which is easier than finding and pushing a button and requires less hand strength.  I only gave it 4 stars for ""Alexa integration"" because we weren't able to get the ""Alexa button"" on the microwave to work. The Dot connected to the oven as soon as we plugged it in, and voice control by asking Alexa worked immediately, but every time we tried to get the button working it said there wasn't a network connection (which there obviously was). Other minor issues are her remembering to use Alexa friendly syntax (""You don't need to be polite."") and this microwave is a little less powerful that her old one so she is having to adjust cook times. But overall it is a great success!

  This is the worst microwave ever. Way too small. If you try to cook a bag of popcorn, good luck. The bag is too big to spin around inside. It’ll burn. A lot of food has this problem. We have square dinner plates. They can’t spin either because they are “too big”. Everything cooks unevenly. It’s also not powerful at all. Whatever cook time your food says, add a bunch of extra time and hope it works out. If you cook it according to the food’s instructions, it’ll be cold. The Alexa integration is cool, I guess, but I’d rather have a regular microwave that can actually heat up food. I bought this 3 months ago, and I’m definitely getting rid of it soon.

  I was in the market for a small microwave for my home theater and this did the job nicely.It was under the budget that I had allowed for a microwave and included Alexa.  It seem to be well built.I added a spare dot that I had laying around.  It took a little fiddling  to set everything up, but once setup it works just fine.  The option of simple manual control is a nice feature.I planned on keeping a bag of popcorn inside, so that I could start it by voice control whenever I was ready for a snack.  The problem with that tells me it will not start because the door has been closed too long.  Not sure what the cutoff time is on the door.  I am a little disappointed in this and that's why I gave only four stars.  Otherwise it is a great unit and I am happy with it.I highly recommend this unit to anyone in the market for a small microwave.  The Alexa feature does not seem to affect the unit cost.

  It's a small, inexpensive microwave with a turntable offering customary features found in other microwaves including defrost mode, one-touch 30-second time addition, and so on. We don't use Alexa, so the Alexa integration is not interesting to us. The microwave can be used without using Alexa, but the engineers who programmed the user interface really expected people to use Alexa for everything, including setting the clock. All of this Alexa baggage can be worked around.Installed this microwave in a van retrofitted as an RV in March 2021, so it will experience vibration and temperature extremes not found in household use.

  Overall this is an excellent microwave.The panel is easy to use and the defrost function is intuitive.However, the Alexa commands are frustrating.I usually have to stop the microwave and re-issue the voice command up to three times, so I don't bother using the Alexa integration.For example, if I issue the command ""microwave power five for three minutes"" it will set the microwave on high for one hour and three minutes.This could be a problem because if I hadn't checked on the time set by Alexa and had gone off to do something for an hour I could have come back to a microwave that was on fire.Also, the popcorn function only works with the popcorn you order using the ""order popcorn"" voice command. Other brands of popcorn burn even when you issue a voice command with the right weight.I tried using the voice commands for a few days but gave up and fell back to just using the buttons on the microwave.

As if we don't have enough additives in our food. Anyway. Buyer beware and count the days to see how long yours last.P.S. Didn't vent moisture very or hardly at all also.

Imagine if you can reach a microwave, but cannot read the buttons well enough to select times or modes.

  Well, I still don't understand why you need Alexa on a microwave unless it somehow can grab the food and place it inside itself on its own, otherwise why? Also the power on this thing is awful, had to microwave a small frozen freezermeal dish for 3x as long as the directions said to (yes it was on full power). I mean, it was the least expensive option we could find because we don't really NEED a microwave but caved to allow our preteen/teens to heat up food and stop complaining about having to heat on the stove. Wouldn't recommend for everyday use thats for sure.

  Very average microwave. Alexa constantly disconnects, so is pointless. I gave up trying to re-pair it. Wish I’d bought a cheap $40 microwave instead of wasting $60 on this.Update, feb 2020: I tried the Alexa controls again a few months back and they worked perfectly. That’s the good news.Unfortunately, my wife put a bag of popcorn in there last night and it expanded, stuck to the plate on the side and what looked like a lightning storm erupted inside. Pretty terrifying. I would say this microwave is dangerously small. Maybe this happens with all tiny microwaves? Anyway, ours is junk now. When I tried it later I got the same sparks and loud buzzing sound. I put it out for the trash and bought a larger one today. Lesson learned.

  This is a good microwave but you need to keep your Alexa powered device near it. Mine I keep about ten feet away and have to yell at it to get the times to register. Also I have standard sized plates and the don’t easily fit (see attached photos.) You have to tilt the plate to get it in which as you can imagine would be problematic when loaded with your meal. Also, 700W is a little under powered but something that can be worked with. Long story short, if they make a slightly bigger model and go up to 1000 or 1200w I would highly recommend d this product.

  This microwave is not worth your cash. It’s tiny, so yes it will fit in small spaces. However, you can’t fit a full-sized dinner plate inside of it and it takes at time double the time to heat things than in a larger microwave. I’ve had it less than 6 months and the keypad plastic covering has already separated from the pad and we are NOT a high use household. It seems that food is taking longer to heat and it’s not heating evenly. I reached out to Amazon and they informed me that AmazonBasics is independently owned and that they could not help me.

  I have had this product for a little over two years now but a microwave should last longer and never melt. As you can see in the image (sorry for the quality the microwave is small) the paint has begun to melt, bubble, and burn in the roof of the microwave. My microwave isn't (very) dirty, I believe the brown spots are rust underneath the paint.I am very light on the microwave use. I mainly use it to heat water for coffee and occasionally I will gently warm up leftovers.Other issues - it disconnects from Alexa if the power goes out. In a rural area this can happen multiple times a year with bad weather. I often thought the voice control would be nifty for those with visual or other impairments but if it needs reconnected three times a year I doubt it. I eventually just stopped reconnecting it. Additionally most microwaves quick buttons only require you hit the button and it will automatically start with this you must always hit start before it will run. Nothing major but if you have to hit multiple buttons no matter what, why offer the quick heat buttons?I genuinely understand what I am getting when I order a 700 watt microwave. I am aware that it will be smaller and heat a little more gently than a standard sized microwave. In a smaller apartment this is fine for me. I do expect quality though and having a microwave literally melt and rust is unacceptable.

  I liked the fact that you can use Alexa with the microwave I very Disliked the size. So the microwave works as intended though in order to use the Alexa features you will need an Alexa device that you can Control it from whether it be your phone or An Echo dot etc. Other than that it's your basic Microwave. I didn't like the size, changing my previous microwave the one thing that stands out is the Size, this thing is VERY small!. I had trouble with some pop corn because it was so small, it got stuck and somewhat burned a little of the wall inside because it got stuck and proceeded to cook while in place which managed to burn the side on the inside, so popping some corn? Make sure you keep an eye on it. Even after getting smaller packs it still manages to get caught against the sides, so again this microwave is SMALL. The Alexa features are cool but I typically don't use some unless I'm doing multiple things at once and I don't have the time to type in the timer so using Alexa can come in handy, would I recommend this? Yes, if you need an extra microwave and need a cheap one this one is pretty cheap and works as intended but, if you're looking to switch to a new one I wouldn't. You could get a better bigger one where you don't have keep check on it when microwaving certain things.

  To be honest, I thought putting automation control in a microwave seems kind of silly because you have to put the food in it anyway. I only bought this because it was only about $10 more than a microwave of comprable size. I was so wrong. Until now, I had never used all the various features of a microwave. I don't think I'll ever be able to go back to a regular microwave. I simply tell Alexa how many pounds and defrost, the clock Auto sets, I've been playing with the power levels because it's so easy to say power 5, or power 10, Etc. If my hands are full I can stop the microwave early without touching it. If I want to cook something a little more then the time I originally set, all I have to do is ask Alexa to add more time...

  I have bought a number of Amazon Basics products.  Some have been surprisingly high-quality for the purchase price.  This is not such an item.  This microwave is poorly constructed and does not last long.  My main complaint regarding construction is that the plastic that covers the key-pad peels away after only a few weeks of light use.  Additionally, my unit had a short-circuit and blew out after less than a year of daily use.  Lastly, compared to other microwaves, I do not find the controls to be particularly intuitive.  Bottom line: do not buy this microwave.  There are better options out there for a similar price.

  I will say a couple good things first. For the price, it's a good microwave - especially for small spaces. I rarely used it but  when i did, it did the job for the most part (except everything was slightly undercooked).My first biggest complaint is just that,  it's weak - it requires about 2-3x the time it usually takes a normal microwave to cook. The Alexa feature isn't helpful at all but it's a cute try. This is what they were banking on but using the buttons is less time consuming. Good luck trying to tell Alexa to ""heat up a cup of coffee""!The worst part though - it didn't even last me a year. It decided to stop working out of nowhere and now it just makes a loud noise with the light on and doesn't heat anything one bit. Kinda bummed cuz I wasted $60 - no help from Amazon since I didn't get the extra protection (it died LESS than a year of owning it - I have to buy extra protection after 6 months?? ugh why did i get this) - and now it's probably going to end up in a landfill polluting our planet. And the pain of realizing you could have gotten a way better microwave with that extra $60.  I guess you get what you pay for.The bottom line: If I were you I'd avoid this altogether unless for it's a dorm room or a very tight space. You should also get the 2 year protection plan which is basically its lifetime warranty since it isn't going to last any longer than 2 years and will probably have a few mechanical issues along the way. It's worth the extra money for the better microwave.

  It's a microwave. It heats up food. So for that it performs fine. Alexa integration works smoothly and if you're in a college dorm or really tight studio apt. this takes up as little space as a microwave can and it's very easy to use. I mean it's a ""Basic"" microwave.That being said at just 700W I'm finding that I probably should have went with a stronger microwave. My previous microwave was almost 20 years old and was 1,000W. Dropping 300 watts seems to make heating food take almost twice as long and the size makes for a tight fit for a regular sized dish and some microwave foods.So if you use large bowls/dishes and are looking for a microwave that cooks food quicker than the oven, you might want to pick up a slightly larger more powerful microwave.

  Currently the least expensive microwave available is the Mainstays 700w from Walmart, which is 49.99, or about ten dollars less.Is this one worth an extra tenner? Absolutely.It's a better feeling product for starters, and with Alexa in addition it's incredibly useful. While voice-commanding a microwave seems gimmicky, it really isn't. The real advantage is being able to microwave items on different power levels, meaning that food comes out eatable and not dried out.Also, and this is a major plus... this is the only microwave I've ever had that sets it's own time. Yep, that's right, it sets itself. I hate keeping the microwave synced up to the correct time, especially when the power goes out.

  I bought this to put in a bedroom.  My wife gets some relief from her migraines with hot packs, but having to go downstairs to heat them in the kitchen can be burdensome.  The small size of this microwave is fine for this use case, although power cord is a little short for what I need.  It's super convenient to be able to operate this in complete darkness with a nearly whispered word to Alexa.  Unfortunately, the beeper on this is pretty loud, especially when you have a migraine.  It would be really really nice to be able to adjust the volume or mute this entirely.  I'm considering disassembly to locate and destroy the speaker.

  This is not much more than any regular microwave. It's pretty standard in size and power, but it has Alexa added and that makes everything easier. I had another microwave until now. Same 0.7 cubic feet and 700w of power. I'm going to compare it to that one.My old microwave: - 0.7 cubic feet - 700w power - 5 power levels - Plastic top and sideAlexa microwave: - 0.7 cubic feet - 700w power - 10 power levels - Metal top and sideBoth are priced at $60. My old one had a weaker-looking cable, this cable is pretty thick. Both had a nearly identical keypad, but my old one had more presets for different types of food vs this one uses Alexa so I'm guessing this actually has more presets. Old one just had buttons for it, this one is in a cloud database.Overall: I'm really happy with this. It is well-priced, well-built, and well-implemented with Alexa. It's not a super powerful microwave, but I don't need that much power anyway. Honestly, if you're planning on buying a similar microwave, chances are that another brand will be basically the same price but without the smart functionality.

  This is cute little microwave - great space saver for sure, but the functionality is terrible.  I just tried to heat up some beef stew - a usual two minute job in a Kenmore microwave.  Six minutes later, I determined that I should just throw the stew in a pot and reheat it on the stove.  (And this was on power control 10).  I am so disappointed.  I am a huge fan of Amazon and Amazon Basics but this is just the worst.  I don't see myself carrying this to UPS to return so lesson learned.

  I'm going, to be honest.  I love technology, so anything I can affordably get my hands on that will be fun and useful to use is just what I am looking for.  The microwave itself is very nice. Quiet looks well made, very easy to use manually.  Add Alexa to the mix, and say I know I want popcorn later, but not sure when.  I stick the popcorn in the microwave, and when I'm ready I say ""Alexa, microwave 3 minutes""  And she does. Confirms the time, and starts the microwave. HOW COOL IS THAT?! I'm a sucker for this kind of thing, but it really is great. Even without Alexa, this microwave is really nice, and it seems to take less time to cook things. I'd recommend it!

  Works great as a microwave. It's 700 watts so you may need to cook a little longer than if you're used to a 600 watt or higher power microwave. The cavity is a bit small too, but you knew that from the specs. And it holds water condensation? Kinda weird but if I microwave a burrito in the winter and close the door there will be a considerable amount of condensed water inside.Okay, so what's the ""fun factor""?Alexa. My mother in law is from Puerto Rico and I die laughing because she ~loves~ to use the Echo to turn on the microwave. Won't use it any other way. And the Echo is so patient:""Alexa!

  For all of the complaints that this doesn't perform like a heavy-duty microwave:  guess what?  It's not.This is a small, 700-watt microwave, and it acts like it.  But, it acts like it WITH Echo integration.  And that's what I like.

  Personally, I have little use for a microwave, now, having said that, I do use it a lot to boil water, for my coffee press. Have used it to warm things up and cook a potato, works as advertised. Great for one or two people, but it is small. I bought it to use Alexa so, much like STTNG, nerds know what I'm talking about, I get to say, to the air around me, ""Alexa, two minutes"" and, no replicator, but two minutes later I can make coffee in my French Press.For the price, it's a great device, even if you don't have an Echo, but if you do, and are a Star Trek fan, it's an amazing device, for fantasy use, Alexa cannot find the photon torpedoes, yet, get to work on that, Amazon, I think my neighbors are Romulan spies !I gave this microwave five stars, works as advertised, simple setup, your network will even set the display on the time, great, right ? The price is more than reasonable, just a nice little microwave, with Star Trek fantasy operations. This would be great if you could add a limited Echo dot and speaker so you could ask your microwave ""Alexa, how do I cook eggs in a microwave"", get it, Amazon ? Price would go up, but think of the functionality !

  If all you need to do is heat up a cup of coffee and also need to do so from across the room (ignoring that you have to place the coffee in the thing yourself... next to the control panel...), this microwave is for you. Otherwise, just don't.Yes, it connects to Alexa. Great, I can tell Alexa to warm up the coffee I keep forgetting about. That's it. That's the appeal of this lemon.It is small, that is true. It's not meant for a casserole dish or large mixing bowl, I will give it that. Coffee, tea, or the occasional frozen meal pretty much maxes out it's usefulness. Large mugs need to duck in this thing. I spilled cups because to lift it off the rotating tray, it hits the lip at the top.The rotating tray falls off it's track all the time, it takes a long time to heat things up.

  For the cost this is a great microwave, made better with Alexa. We had a rather large Panasonic for years and it was simply more then we needed. It served us well for 18 years, but began to rust out. The home is pretty much fully automated so adding a Alexa enabled microwave was a no brainier. We certainly have no issues with power, even though it's half the wattage of the Panasonic, it performs great. We don't use the microwave to cook (never have), primarily reheating my coffee and leftovers. Reheated a frozen Scicilian pizza slice and it was thoroughly heated through. The ONLY thing we miss is the push to open door.Amazon will be offering a higher end over the stove model that has air frying, microwave and convection and will be certainly be considered, I can move this little one upstairs to warm hand towels in the bath.

  This works fabulously. It took a little getting use to using the dot with the right wording but beyond that no issues setting it up. It runs extremely quite. Only draw back is it takes longer due to the low wattage.Revised- disappointing after a few months usage. Face cracked, difficulties in keeping joined with network, and worse part is what took a little longer now takes forever. Seems to be loosing power to cook items.

  We had a ton of trouble getting the microwave set up. Every step of the process failed multiple times and required me to start over repeatedly.As an aside, the visually impaired community is a great audience for smart appliances, as evidenced by all the questions and reviews posted here, but the setup process is not accessible -- it requires that you locate and press flat buttons, unlike any other smart device I own, so I had to get a sighted person's help. Not a good start, and now I'm concerned that when it inevitably has connection issues or needs to be reset I'll be stranded (with cold pizza)!The microwave itself is fairly typical for a low-end model. Shockingly tiny, but it'll get the job done. My dinner plates only just fit inside, but they do fit! All in all, I hope a higher-end model is pending, and that the setup process can be vastly improved. I'll still be on board when that happens

  I have had this microwave for well over a year with no problems or complaints. Today it almost caught fire while I was popping a bag of microwave popcorn. It made a loud repetitive buzzing noise, the light inside it flashed on and off, and when I opened the door there was smoke coming out of the vent/light area. This occurrence seems similar to the problems that have been in the news lately. I clean the microwave frequently and there is nothing unusual about how I use it.

  The microwave is small and compact and was designed for basic use. The wattage was not the best for heating things like soap all the way through.

I decided to pour out the water, unplug the microwave and then try it again with bottled water in a cup after the microwave was reset….zap, zap, zap as if a thunderstorm was taking place.I immediately unplugged and will never use this unit again.

I continued to read and overthink everything. I finally decided to take the risk and order it, because it's been easy for me to return items to Amazon.I plugged in the microwave and it immediately synced with my Echo Spot. I read the PDF for cook times and how to ask for different foods to be cooked. The directions are thorough and made perfect sense.

  I got the microwave because my big microwave messed up and figured I could get by with a smaller one instead and seen the Alexa function and figured it could be useful.  It has turned out to be of poor quality, it's smaller than I expected and unfortunately it doesn't heat up the food very well and sometimes it's uneven heat.

  Extremely under powered. My electric tea kettle boils water faster than this thing and boil a cup of water. That said he does have a small form factor in a very simple user interface which is what attracted me to it in the first place, but it takes its time heating things up. Also I don’t understand why the single button cycle which is for 30 seconds does not complete a full rotation of the plate. Meaning that if you put your cup in with the handle facing outward and you press the 30’second button, that handle should be facing outward when the cycle completes. This is just good user interface design for a microwave. It always winds up with half a rotation and handle facing rear.

  I've had this microwave for 18+ months now, and it does not perform. It's incredibly slow to heat anything (boiling a cup of water takes 3-5 minutes), it's incapable of defrosting anything larger than the size of your fist, and it's poorly built. The glass plate slips very slightly out of place at the slightest nudge, meaning it doesn't turn. I've literally knocked it out of place by putting a paper popcorn bag on it.The Alexa integration works well, and the only reason I've persisted with it. My kitchen has limited space, meaning the microwave goes under a unit at shin level - so typing times into a traditional microwave is difficult. Alexa solves for that, as I can just put my food in and yell instructions to Alexa. It rarely fails or mishears me.However, this doesn't offset the fact that my microwave doesn't work for heating or defrosting anything in any reasonable time. I just defrosted a frozen chicken breast for 15 minutes and it's still almost solid. I think it's time to move on.

  I purchased this microwave about 2 months ago for my new apartment. It worked great at first. But while reheating food recently, it started to smell like burning plastic. Upon inspection there was a small piece of plastic that fell in (that was neither hot nor melted). But I figured that was the issue. After a thorough cleaning and microwaving lemon water for 2 minutes (to get the smell out).  It continued to smell like burning plastic. So I was left to assume it is an internal hardware issue. And after reading a recent review about someone's side panel melting off because it over heated. And seeing as I have two small children, the smell was unbearable and I feared it would catch fire. I had no other option but to return it for a refund. Which is upsetting because I am a huge fan of the ""Alexa"" products. And I never got the ""Alexa"" feature to work.

  This was very easy to set up. Connected with my saved network on Amazon right away. Just like any of the Alexa devices, you need to ask in a specific way. For example, I wanted to cook 4 Hot Dogs. I pushed the Alexa button and had to say Hot Dog first. Then she asks ""How Many"" and you can say from 1 to 6! When you want to cook at a lower power, you have to say ""Power 5"" (from 1 to 10) then Alexa asks ""How Long"". Not really a problem though if you are used to speaking with Alexa :) This works (at this time) only with the Dot or Echo. It will not work with my Tap or Fire Tablet in the Show Dock. I comes with about 30 presets like the hot dogs. Here is my wish list for added presets: burrito, pizza, and frozen tv dinner. Hopefully there will be updates with more presets in the near future!

This microwave is small!  I wanted small but it doesn't turn with my square plates and I can't use any dinner plate so far.  We use salad plates which is a helpful psychology aid to portion satisfaction anyways.  Win win.  We are a Google house and I'm not about to be swayed by my microwave.  LoL

  We were not expecting much out of this microwave. We got it for the living room specifically for snacks for the kids and popcorn on movie night. It works very, very well for all that. There's not a single complaint I can come up with. I've tested it with other stuff just because I can... It does well if you remember it's a 700w microwave.I'm a tech nerd, so I thought it would be cool to have the Alexa feature, we actually use it a lot now.

  I've had this microwave almost 3 years. It was awesome the 1st year until the timer started going out, then it stopped connecting to my other Amazon devices (Dot & Echo clock). It still runs, but you have to flick the digital timer with your finger to get it to light up just so that after a few seconds then it'll turn off again. It was excellent when it worked 100%. It still cooks, warms, pops & thaws like it used to, but just wish it was still fully functional.

  The price was attractive, and the idea of having a voice controlled microwave is very clever, but I'm not sure this product is ready for prime time.  First of all, it is underpowered compared to other ovens on the market, but that is not necessarily a huge issue unless you are cooking a lot with this appliance.  I have been having difficulty figuring out what voice commands work with the microwave, and the choices appear to be very limited.  For instance, I have not figured out how to ask the unit to cook at 50% power for 2 minutes.......  When I tried to go online to find help from Amazon, all I see is FAQs, but no access to someone live in Customer Support.  This product needs a little more work before it is going to be a sensible & practical purchase.

  The Alexa-compatible microwave is impressive. Upon unwrapping and setting it up, it automatically displayed the correct time with no assistance from me.  It's functions may be activated with a button on the front, which permits you to speak a command directly to the oven such as ""Defrost one pound"" or ""Heat for two minutes."" Alternately the commands may be spoken to a remote Alexa device, in my case the Echo Dot. It comes with a rotating tray just like larger ovens. There is nothing I dislike about the microwave oven.

  I probably should have read the other reviews more carefully before purchasing, because this seems like a common complaint.  I was very excited about the cost and size of this microwave.  I have a small area set aside, so size was an important factor to me.I haven't owned a microwave for over 10 years, so I was excited for the convenience.  I went to the store and picked up frozen chicken nuggets.  The box said, ""Cook for 1 minute.""  They took 3 minutes, and even then they weren't piping hot.  (I checked the power level just in case and it was at 10.)  The heating was also very uneven.For my use, cooking, I wouldn't recommend this microwave.  I'm returning this microwave and will be paying a bit more for another brand and a higher power rating.

  I really like this little unit and would buy again.  Only reason for 4 stars is it has sometimes lost connection to Echo Dot.  Now that may be my network problem and a reset of Dot fixes problem.  It is only 700 watt and some meals will say ""don't cook with less than 1100 watt microwave"".  But, it works fine with everything I have tried.  Make sure everything is centered so that it can turn freely.  For example, a bag of pop-corn may touch the sides and while the plate is turning it is stuck.  It is very handy for tight places, easy to use at reduced power for defrosting, and works with Alexa 99% of the time.  And you can always use the front buttons like a conventional microwave.

  This is more than what I had hoped for. I wanted a small microwave to supplement the large one over the stove. I grew tired of reaching and yanking the door open. This microwave has become my ""main machine"". I never knew exactly how much time to enter on the old microwave. I like my coffee hot, but often entered insufficient time and received a tepid cup. It is easy to judge volume, and now Alexa calculates the time. It works with the quaint US system or the more universal metric volume or weight.  It heats evenly. After several weeks, I have yet to use the keypad. I did pair it with one of the Alexa devices so I can press the Ask Alexa button, making the operation even easier.The microwave was very easy to set up using the Alexa app. I am delighted with the purchase and the the use of this product.

  This Alexa controlled microwave works great. I purchased it for my mother, who has advanced macular degeneration. At 90 years old, technology can be challenging for her, but she is quickly learning to use Alexa to operate the microwave. I had previously set up Echo Dots and an Echo Connect so she could use voice dialing for the telephone, although, Amazon devices are not required to operate the microwave using Alexa. There is a button on the microwave that allows you to operate the microwave using voice commands without Dots or similar devices. For the visually impaired, this Alexa controlled microwave is incredibly helpful. It would be great to have a larger capacity microwave. Hopefully those will be coming soon. If Amazon develops an Alexa controlled toaster oven, I'll be the first in line to purchase, as she uses one of those more than a microwave.

  We like the voice functionality a LOT.  It's a compact microwave for a small apartment, and it fits the bill perfectly.  Some complain that the wattage is low.  To us, that is fine - we usually lower the power level when using a more powerful microwave anyway so that our food cooks more evenly.The only real problem we have is that I frequently have to re-enable the microwave in the Alexa app.  For no reason that I can determine, it sets itself to Disabled a few times a week.  Perhaps this is related to the ghost that is currently playing random music from time to time out of our echo, at ear-scorching volumes (sorry, dog and cat, I'll unplug it next time I leave), but it could be a ""feature"" that wasn't well thought through.

The first generation microwave is a bit small and only 700 watt; however it has already been much more helpful in the kitchen when I’m getting both babies food ready preparing other dishes at the same time. A simple Alexa button on the device allows me to conviently heat food by using my voice to heat up whatever I need while preparing something else at the same time.  So far I’m digging it.

  It’s only 700w (most microwave instructions are for 1200w), but that makes sense for the price. My issue is that they seemed to try making this a popcorn-centered product, and a standard popcorn bag is too large for the microwave. It gets stuck and can’t spin and has several times caused a small fire when the corner of the bag gets stopped near the heating element. You have to keep stopping it so you can push the bag along to prevent fire. I still use it constantly, the Alexa feature is novel but convenient, and I actually like that it’s small since we don’t use it often and it saves us some counter space.edit: Updated with a photo 3 years later.

  Easy to set up with my Alexa Dot, which integrates very well. I simply say, ""Alexa, microwave for 60 seconds"" (or whatever) and it does it.  Easier than pressing buttons,  and you can add time from across the room. The voice recognition is MUCH better than my car's. The square footage inside is adequate, but I do wish it had higher wattage. Most microwavable products these days give cooking time based on 1,000-1,200 watt ovens, so 700 watts is underpowered, and converting the extra time needed in my head is tricky.

I want to run it off a small Lithium Ion battery connected to a Victron Phoenix 1200 inverter ( https://amzn.to/2N8fEeK ). The Victron is rated for 1200 VA, or roughly 1000 watts.According to the owner manual for model S9N29R. The input power is 1050Watts. I checked this with a Kill-A-Watt meter and it is close to that. So far I have heated up frozen Burritos in 2.5 minutes and it has worked well with the battery/inverter (It usually take 2minutes in my big GE over range microwave).I don't plan to use it with Alexa. The standby power consumption is 1-2 watts.Unfortunately it does not work with the Inverters ECO mode. The microwave keeps turning on/off. So I will return it

  Well, I've had it for a little over a year and after pretty much complete dissatisfaction for the whole time I've owned it, I am finally throwing it in the trash. It's always been under-powered with some items taking nearly twice the suggested time, but that was expected. The main problem it has is long cooking times, anything over about 5 minutes is hit or miss, and if you have to cook something for over 10 minutes, the whole microwave gets so hot that it doesn't feel safe, and it stops heating at all. Although the Alexa features were a nice gimmick, I never used them past the first week, mainly because it was almost impossible to keep connected to a network or reconnect after an unplug. Within the first week the display also became loose, and although it can be jiggled back in place temporarily, it's a major sign of sloppy construction and bad design. All in all I'm disappointed in Amazon for putting their name on such a lousy product, and wish I had never wasted the money.

  The microwave is very easy to use. There is an Alexa app for windows 10 that you can install and use it for the microwave as well as other things but you need a bluetooth dongle or built in bluetooth to use. Setting up was easy.I suggest that you Google for a conversion chart 700  vs 1100 for cooking times. I added at least 3 minutes on a 7 minute cook time for a frozen dinner and maybe could have added another minute for good measure. However you need to experiment to satisfy yourself. The chart that I downloaded makes for a start and I think that Amazon should include on with the unit....hint..hint...hint.

  It's a good, basic microwave. Has the look and feel of the older basic GE microwaves- magnetic door lock, glass turntable, flat membrane controls and digital display. The 700W of power makes a standard microwave popcorn in just over 2 minutes without burning it, and can heat up a small plate of food in under 2 minutes. NOTE: It will only accommodate small plates, and round plates work best. Square plates tend to get bogged down while rotating and thus heating can be uneven.In short its a good microwave for the small dollars.

  The selling point of this microwave—Alexa integration—works like a charm. The ability to access presets like popcorn or beverage, or the ability to just say “2 minutes on high” instead of having to remember whether this particular microwave prefers power or time first is invaluable. HOWEVER, all that time and brainpower you saved will be reabsorbed as you will constantly have to readjust cooking times based on the low wattage of this particular 700 watt microwave.example:(for 1200 watt oven): Cook at 50% for 4 minutes and then an additional 1.5 minutes on high.“ALEXA, WHAT PERCENTAGE OF 700 IS 1200?” (700 watts vs the instructions for the 1200 watt oven)171.4285%“ALEXA, WHAT IS 171% OF 4” (increasing time according to the delta between the wattage)6.84“ALEXA WHAT IS 84% OF 60” (translating “.84” into seconds)50.4“ALEXA MICROWAVE AT 50% FOR 6 MINUTES AND 50 SECONDS”and so on and so forth.

And then, it was all over.The fact that it isn’t even a year old is very disheartening, I’ve never had an appliance that couldn’t hold on for several years.When I was looking for a new microwave and came across this one, I read through the bad reviews and assumed that it came down to user error for most of them. Now, unfortunately, I see that I was wrong. It seems this model is faulty at best, dangerous at worst.

  Update: After 2 years the microwave is no longer working and for the past 6 months was giving off odd burning smells. Seems a little fishy that it crapped out at almost exactly 2 years which is how long they offer the warranty for. My original review is below.Great little microwave! Exactly what I was looking for!! Not too big and fits most medium size plates that I use in my house. The Alexa integration is a nice touch especially considering the price. I am not a big microwave popcorn fan, which is good because average bags will not fit and will burn, so if you plan to use this for popcorn you are out of luck and posing a potential fire hazard. Luckily, this is not an issue for me.

  We have now been through 2 of these microwaves. I love the Alexa integration and wish there was a higher quality microwave available but these are nothing but a danger. We had our first one for just a few weeks before it sparked and caught fire and melted. We contacted Amazon and they sent us a replacement which we have had for about a year, and two days ago it did the same thing. Sparked and caught fire. I want so bad for these to work but they are not worth the danger.

It is small, but perfect for apartments and dorms- or the game room where we put ours for snacks when visitors come over.

  We've had this microwave for a couple of years and it's been alright, but then today the inside side piece caught fire when my 8 year old was right next to it. I searched online for similar reports, and found this CNN article which cites a similar case. They had it tested by the University of Maryland, which ""determined that the way the panel was secured could allow debris such as food or grease to collect behind it and possibly ignite. As soon as the researchers turned it on, the microwave began sparking and smoking, causing it to react as if its user put foil or other metal inside.""

I basically use it as I would any microwave oven but I don't have to press any buttons. Yes, that matters to someone with limited vision. Defrost two pounds of chicken? No problem.

  Bought this very small microwave almost a year ago. At first I thought ok, maybe I can live with the smaller size as we usually only use it to reheat anyway. It seems to take more than twice as long as my 1100 watt microwave to reheat foods. About a week ago it started making a strange noise and sparks flew from the little side panel anytime it was used, even for a 30 second interval.  I thought it was going to catch on fire! Now I’m afraid to use it and fear I’m going to have to just throw it away and replace it. The Alexa feature is cute and can be handy, but it’s really not that hard to push a couple buttons either.

  I just needed a small, inexpensive microwave with quick delivery when my regular one pooped out during quarantine.  It's only 700 watts, so I have to adjust cooking times longer than my regular 1200 watt microwave, but it works great.  I don't use the Alexa feature so I can't speak to that.  Also, I'm not sure there's a way to set the clock time without Alexa, but since this is more of a countertop kitchen appliance (like my George Forman grill or Instapot), I only plug it in when I need it and use my oven clock if I need to know what time it is.

  should have kept my other microwave - as an impulse purchase this was a mistake.  I didn't realize how long you have to extend microwave instructions with 700watts, they may have changed the listing title since product launch when I thought this was a normal strength microwave on my quick Black Friday purchase.  Not docking them for that, I am not able to rate it highly because the Alexa function requires permissions on your phone so they are tracking more than just the microwave it would seem (microphone data).  So I won't set that up, and the buttons have a thin seran wrap-like film over them which quickly bubbles up and will likely tear one of these days.

It was pretty easy to connect. It's so nice to just tell Alexa how long you need to microwave to cook for. One thing to realize is that its a 700W microwave, so if you are use to cooking with 1100w, you will need to adjust your timing so your food will be cooked - FYI. I didn't realize it was only 700w - I guess I was so excited, didn't even think of check the wattage. As long as you convert your cooking times, you'll be fine. :) Love this microwave.

It wouldn’t last long and we rarely use a microwave. A year later it would do this almost every time we used.

  I should add photos. It retains moisture and I live in a dry desert climate. I bought it almost 2 years ago.  It might be my imagination but seems to be less than 700 watts as it's very slow.

  It's great for a small space, and easy enough to use; the interface could be streamlined a little though. I don't use the Alexa integration. Unless you're heating up something small, this microwave is going to have it's work cut out for it. I bought it for a break room dinner warmer upper. Most nights I'm heating my single Tupperware of din dins for 3 to 5 minutes just to get it hot again( my microwave at home heats the same meal in under 2 minutes). This one is really under powered, and can't keep up if there is a line to use the microwave in the break room.

  We've hated this thing since day one. It was a gift. I wish we never got it. It's small, underpowered, and the Alexa integration is really dumb and not needed. They made a big deal about the popcorn function but the popcorn generally came out very inconsistent. Same settings all the time but sometimes the popcorn was burned and sometimes under done. Then the paint started peeling really bad thank God! A reason to throw it out and upgrade. Don't give this microwave a second thought. Just buy from a reputable brand that has been making microwaves for years. I've also seen many people reported this as a fire hazard.

I had a similarly sized microwave before this and the Amazon microwave cooks food much better. Just remember that it is 700 W and you have to adjust the time for the items to cook properly.

  Can't stand when you start a new purchase and it comes dented right off the bat; already things aren't going to good(delivered by Amazon).Second the microwave seems to work, haven't tried it yet, wondering if there will be radiation leaking because of the dent lol.The Alexa integration was difficult, I'm guessing because my echo is in room next door.  Even after connecting, seems that the microwave actually needs your Alexa device in order to process the command. In other words I thought that the microwave listened to your command, it's not, the echo had to listen to your command & send instruction to the microwave.  Works, but awkward if echo device in other room

  I purchased this via Amazon Warehouse open box because the price was too good to pass up.  I've never had a smart appliance before as my Alexa is less than a year old.  The integration was super fast and easy and my daughter and I get a kick out of the fact we can ask Alexa to microwave something for us.  A dinner plate barely fits into the microwave, I do wish it was a little larger, but it works for us.  I would buy another smart appliance if it worked so well with Alexa.

  Our last (& very expensive) microwave finally died on us not too long ago & we needed a replacement right away. Tried going to all the usual big box stores & all they had were air-fryers & air-fryer toaster oven combinations.  I already had an air-fryer (fancy Christmas gift) & just wanted a plain microwave (for coffee, hot chocolate & such).  This definitely fulfills that basic & simple, not to mention easy to use. The integration with Alexa is very nice feature as well.  Would definitely recommend as a replacement.

  Super cool that Alexa can warm up my food or drinks while I’m on the toilet. But this microwave is giving me a size complex. It’s small. Which wouldn’t be a problem if it was powerful. But it’s not. Even on max power, it takes almost 2 minutes to heat a cup of coffee. My old microwave took 45 seconds. The lack of power and increase in time isn’t a problem when I’m otherwise occupied answering natures call, but is a bit of a pain when I’m running late for work and need a quick coffee warm up. The Alexa functionality works perfectly though so it does have some convenient features.

  I replaced a similar sized microwave with this one.  I have microwavable meals that require ""5 minutes on full power, then 4 minutes at 50% power"" or similar.  The instructions led me to believe only one dot would control this, but I can successfully insert the term microwave on any of my devices and the microwave will react.  So I load the microwave, ""Alexa microwave 5 minutes"" and then from another room 5 minutes later, ""Alexa microwave 4 minutes power 5.""  The microwaves I compared this to available in my local market of similar size were very similarly priced.  I don't even think I paid extra.  As with anything Alexa there can be confusion with speech patterns but the product is great once you learn the lingo and Amazon seems to continue to expand the pattern of understanding as time goes on.Was cool until it caught fire.

  It's super quiet during the heating process, but it also burned our food first day we got it and has been making the kitchen air and food thats heated up in the microwave smell like burned food ever since then. Plus it's also been permanently stained since then too and nothing I've done to clean it has successfully gotten the stain or the stench out. I tried to replace it with the same microwave via customer service chat and email but their customer service chat team has grown suddenly retarded and clueless and unhelpful with every issue you bring to them until you confront them on their unhelpfulness, like 5 skittishly attention-deficit Talking Heads later. And their email team has been neutured completely, unable to handle even the slightest issue because ""it's not allowed via email"". I have depression and memory problems so I like to avoid phone talk as much as possible plus I hate repeating myself and when I have to repeat myself by chat I can merely copy and paste what I said to the last 3 or 4 silly bots to the next clueless bot without having to try to remember it all. Also, Alexa worked fine with my tv firestick but I can't use the Alexa button on the microwave without buying another pricey product (echo, I think). And the microwave is conveniently small and therefore easy to move and place in small areas but too small for even some of our smaller ceramic plates to comfortably fit in, making loud clangy noises from start to finish whenever the turntable tries to spin the ceramic plate around the 4 tight walls in the heating process. The numbers on the menu are easy to use, ranging from 1 to 9 minutes (+0) and all you have to do is pick one number, then press the start button and it heats up for that amount of minutes, without you having to press the zero button or any other button but Start. And it is good with heating stuff up, although it would be easier to use if it warned us that it was too good at it and would burn our food at only 3 minutes. But we need a microwave, I got this on sale, and I'm chronically broke, so I can't afford to pay for anything more yet.

  We bought this because there were sparks flying out of the other microwave. You know, we have five cats and trying to catch them all before the house burns down wasn't worth the hassle so we bought this because it was cheap, and it was Amazon. What can go wrong? Well, it's not bad. It doesn't have many of the frilly bits our previous microwave had. Stuff like reheat options for different types of food. This is that no frills cheap microwave. But it heats stuff up and that's all we really need it to do.Biggest pitfall, this is tiny. You can fit a dinner plate in there but no larger. That's not terrible but if you had a nice big microwave and go to this then you might be left wondering what you are doing. We are.But then again, it's my task to clean out the microwave.

  Just a heads up- I didn't click the link to read the manual before ordering- you can't put anything in there ahead of time to heat later. After 10 minutes voice activation won't work until you open and shut the door again. I think this thing is more novelty than anything, though it would be great for blind people. It doesn't work all that great, and it arrived with a hole in the back.

  This compact Microwave is perfect for reheating a cup of coffee or leftovers. Popcorn also cooks well in it. I prepared myself by reading reviews and knew it wouldn't be as powerful as my 1200W microwave that I was replacing. I read it wasn't very powerful but if you don't need it for serious cooking then it works well.I have it set up to respond to my request so all I do is ask Alexa to cook for so many minutes and it automatically turns the microwave on and she repeats the request. This is amazing to my family (especially Grandsons) and friends. There is one drawback to this, however.

When it arrived it was smaller than expected but I was cool with that; the setup was simple and didn’t take much time at all. For the setup and price I give it 5 stars; I wish this microwave was available in a different size. Every bag of popcorn I’ve put in the microwave has either started smoking or caught fire. The bags expand and rub on the heating element. I usually stand and watch as the bags pop to avoid any fires. Fast forward two years later and the microwave has kicked the bucket; I went to warm up a meal and sparks started flying almost like a short circuit. Currently looking for a replacement.

  I bought this microwave in December 2019.  It worked fine at first and worked with Alexa.  It is now July 2020 and it is totally dead.  It started not getting as hot a few weeks ago and I noticed it would take longer to cook a baked potato for instance.  Then all of a sudden, it stopped working completely.  It just doesn't get anything even a little hot.In general, it is a little too small because popcorn bag would get stuck while turning.Better off investing a little more

  First of all, this DOES WORK with the original Echo. Product page is unclear on this, and some external reviewers seem to think you need to have a later Echo. Even the Amazon tech support staff I spoke to were unsure. You will have to get your Echo on the most current firmware, which for older Echos can take overnight. Also, you must have your Amazon account set to the US, since they don't sell this anywhere else it won't show up in the Alexa app if you have your Amazon or even Kindle account set to UK (as I did for buying Kindle books that weren't available in US).Eventually got through all of these issues with the help of Amazon's support staff. Controlling microware w/ voice is great.

  Let me start by saying this is a SMALL microwave. But, we aren't a Microwave household...So for us, it's perfect! I love the Alexa integration! Is it flawless, no... Does it work just about every time? Yes. I would not recommend this size for more than two people or for a house that survives via a microwave... but for a quick re-heat, the occasional microwave meal, steam in the bag veggies... It gets the job done! I always add about 15-30 seconds extra because it's not the most powerful, but other than that... I'm happy with this purchase!

  Ok, I didn't buy this microwave for the Alexa integration. We have Alexa, and we've set it up for the microwave. Very easy to do if thats the route you want to go. But here's the thing- until Amazon can program AI to put something in the microwave too, I'm already up and might as well push the button on the microwave if I'm standing in front of it. That being said, it is a small microwave, which I prefer. Its very quiet when its running, simple to use, and looks great in the kitchen. Very happy with the purchase, but Alexa integration seems silly until Amazon delivers the ""Microwave Hopper""

  I purchased this Microwave in July 2021, I stopped using it in December 2021 due to it causing smoke when I turn it on and also has a burnt panel as it show on the pictures. Tried returning it to amazon and can't reach its customer service. I like that it has alexa and its small. But it does what the other negative reviews say, it smokes after awhile and also burns the panel. I tried getting a refund and also a replacement if refund not availabld and no response by amazon.

  This microwave was ok at first. I bought it because I like using Alexa. That part barely ever worked. We totally gave up using Alexa after a few months. Now that it's over a year old, it barely even works. Everything we try to cook or heat up takes quite a bit loner than it did when the microwave was new and much longer than any directions for the food we are cooking. Would not recommend as now after a year using this thing, I am now looking for a new one.

  Works well even though lower power. Looks good, seems solid enough. No horrible logos all over it. Alexa is a little unforgiving and won’t do any best guessing - you need to get the syntax right, but great when you learn it if you don’t have your glasses handy to see the keypad! Setup may take a couple of tries - I had to reset and start over when it glommed onto the wrong network.

  I picked this up as a pre-order because, coincidentally, my current microwave ""died."" I put ""died"" in quotes because what actually happened was a circuit breaker on another outlet tripped and instead of killing just that outlet, it killed a whole slew of outlets on that wall. But anyway, it was only $60.First off, it is SMALL! My fault for not really visualizing the dimensions, but my previous one could fit a full-sized dinner plate and then some. This one will only fit if you tilt it to get it into the unit. The left wall is concave so once its in, it will sit flat. But that won't help if you need to microwave a large bowl of liquid or something. But despite that, it's tolerable.The setup was extremely quick and easy. It was literally plug and play and choose which device I wanted to link it to. Unfortunately if you change up your network, you may run into problems. Not long after I got it, I purchased a new router and changed my SSID, password, and other technical bits. Long story short, it was basically a new network and I had to rejoin everything. Everything worked except the microwave. Reading online (which was buried in a support page somewhere...you'd think it would be more prominent), the trick is to hold the ""2"" button for four seconds until it beeps, then pair it with Alexa again. However, nowhere could I find what you should do when you press the ""2"" button for four seconds and the display reads ""fail"" and I can't pair it. Yeah, it's a support thing that could be resolved with a phone call, but it seems that this could be easily documented somewhere for those of us who are a little more technically inclined.So all in all, great price, a little small, and cool when it works with Alexa. Functions normally even when not paired, you just can't talk to it.EDIT: I changed it to 4 stars from 3 because, really, aside from it being a little small, it's perfect for the price and my issues could probably be resolved by tech support.

  Works great as a normal microwave.  Food gets hot etc..  We put this in our work break area.  The Alexa integration is somewhat strange.  If we ask Alexa to start the microwave it will only operate if the microwave door was active within a certain period of time.  Really we don't see why Alexa would come in handy other than placing something in the microwave then a few minutes later deciding to heat it up without going to the microwave again.  We have yet to come across this particular scenario.  Fortunately, this was a great deal with or without Alexa and we did not purchase it caring to use Alexa with it.  I will say it has been somewhat amusing to put something in the microwave then walk back to your desk and start it using Alexa!

  Our old microwave had been giving us trouble for a few months. At this price, we decided to give it a shot and have been very pleased. Even without Alexa, it does the job that it needs to do. A lot of people seem to think it's kind of small but it's the same size as every microwave I've ever owned and I've never considered any of them small.The Alexa integration works almost perfectly. Every now and then, our Alexa won't hear me after I press the button but it's extremely rare. It's happened less than 5 times since we bought it in August.I will say that we always use the button on the Microwave opposed to saying, ""Alexa, Microwave..."" because we found less success with the latter. However, anytime we use the microwave, we're standing right there at it so what would be the point of not just hitting the button and saying, ""2 minutes.""

  When i first got this microwave i really loved it as well as my family. We loved that the buttons were simple to use (i.e. 2 meant 2mins, 3 = 3mins and so on), it heated up the food very well which was the problem with our last microwave which prompted us to buy this one but i guess it heated it too well. I don’t think it has a well ventilated system, we started noticing that after every use it left a small pool of water from the steam that was produced. The longer the time heat, the more water, so we would have to always leave the door open to let the steam out but it was a little too late, the paint around the door frame had started to peel off and rust. We didn’t really mind, disappointed yes, but it worked so meh. Then 1 year to the buy date  (bought Nov 2018 - Lasted till Nov 19) it sparked and stopped working. I added something to heat for 30sec, worked fine for 10 sec and then it started flickering and sparking, i pushed the door open to stop the heating process. I thought it was odd, what i was heating wasn’t anything i shouldn’t have and the bowl it was in was plastic and i had heated it 2 mins prior heating it again. I switched it to a different plate and this time around it did the same thing but with the added smoke, i turned it off and unplugged it ASAP, once i opened the door and smell like something was burning and it wasn’t what i was heating up. I was bummed, the microwave only lasted for a year, a year! I has some high hopes for it that kept faltering once it started to peel. It fit perfect on out kitchen counter, it wasn’t bulky, i loved that i never had to reset the clock because the lights went out or because the time changed, it had everything going for it except longevity. I couldn’t even get a refund because i only bought a 1yr warranty and it had expired 2wk prior this but that’s on me. The only solace i can take is i didn’t pay full price for it since i used a gift card given to me from work so i guess that’s an upside.

  I needed a small microwave and this one was affordable.The Alexa stuff is a little gimmicky but it comes in handy when you want to stop the microwave while you’re busy. I can see myself using it more with time.The size is small and doesn’t fit my dinner plates but I rarely need to reheat a large plate of stuff.Heating is where it starts to lack. It takes a long time to warm things up but I assumed it would from other reviews and the amount of power it has. It’s not a huge problem but if you’re in a hurry a lot then you might want to get a microwave with more power. Probably not for a family but works fine for a dorm or small apartment.I do notice a sort of plastic smell if I heat things longer than a minute but it’s something I’ll have to watch as I haven’t had this for over a month.Overall, it does a fine job for me. Hopefully Amazon makes a larger one with more power but i am okay with this one for now.

  It’s definitely a smaller microwave which doesn’t bother me because I’m in a small studio but I cannot get Alexa working on it which isn’t a big deal I bought this for the price point but.. it takes a while to heat food up. If I’m eating a small frozen meal I’ll have to cook it for 2 intervals of 3 minutes each. No problem cooking a bag of popcorn for 3 minutes but the bag is a little too big in there once it’s popped. That’s kind of annoying but not a deal breaker. I don’t recommend this to anyone who needs a microwave for their house or for multiple people to use.

  It works exactly as a microwave should. It has plenty of power and does the job. Cleaning is easy and it fits nicely on my kitchen counter. My only complaint is you can't set the time on the microwave until you connect it to Alexa and have wifi. I moved into my new apartment before the wifi was set up so I couldn't set the time. Once everything was set up the clock flashed on perfectly. If I had an Alexa I'm sure I'd use those features, but as of right now it's not something I can utilize.

  I love this little microwave! It’s perfect for my needs and is great for apartment living, as it doesn’t take up much space. Easy setup and my echo linked to it right away. You don’t have to use the voice activation, but it definitely makes for a neat experience and is helpful for those of us who reheat coffee or tea and then forget about it- just tell Alexa to heat it up again! Some advice, don’t put anything on top of it. It must have a sensor or something because I had a popcorn box on mine and kept getting an error message (and Alexa kept saying there was a problem). For a minute I thought it had died but, after I took the box off of it, it worked again! Definitely recommend this for anyone in an apartment or dorm who isn’t looking to mic a family-style dinner. **B&B 3-wick Candle for size reference (I’m not using it to cook candles over here).

  We got this because we've never liked our existing microwave and have gotten used to controlling things around the house with Alexa. The old microwave was bulky and the display difficult to read.The Amazon microwave is smaller with a bright and easy to read display. I now have one less device in the house that has to have its clock set after a power outage. It's not just a voice controlled microwave, it has routines to do things like defrost frozen vegetables or reheat a plate of leftovers. All the features to do this were on my old microwave but we never used them because deciding on a time and powerlevel and translating that into multiple button presses was too inconvenient. I expect more routines will be added as time goes on.We did not have to buy another Echo to control the microwave as we already had one nearby. As part of the setup, you associate a specific Echo to activate when pressing the Alexa button on the device. This allows for shorter commands and it seems easier for the associated Echo to hear those commands since it knows you're at the microwave and it's expecting a command related to it. You can still say ""Alexa"" from any of your Echos and tell it to do something with the microwave and it will work. The button is just a convenience when you're standing in front of the device. Note that, as a safety feature, if it's been too long since the door has been opened, it won't fire up the microwave.This microwave has slightly less power than our old one but the few extra seconds for heating a plate of leftovers is more than compensated by the convenience of use.

  I liked this microwave, and it lasted almost 3 years (11/2018-08/2021). I would buy it again in a larger size. I didn't have any problem with the small size or 700 wattage, but my family complained endlessly about it. Today it gave me the buzz-buzz-buzz with the flickering light and it went straight into the trash. I thought I would use the Alexa feature, but never did.

  I do not use the Alexa function which I'm sure is awesome... But the little Microwave is as close to perfect functionality as I've ever seen. I purchased this to replace a large, High Powered Microwave I've had for years. This smaller Microwave does a much better job of cooking evenly (without drying out and burning)! Awesome little high quality Microwave. I use this Dailey for my cooking needs and I have yet to be disappointed. Great Job Amazon. Thankyou for producing an awesome little Microwave at a price for anyone!

  Liked it. Was expecting little more power. So warming up a cup of coffee takes 1 min on max power which was 1/2 a minute in our primary microwave (the big one).. but I think it's okay to keep it as a bar heating tool. Setting up the clock (w/ no Alexa) was almost impossible w/o the manual which could be easier. Other than these I liked the product and surely recommend for this price.

  On March 9th I will have had this microwave for one year.  At first it was great.  Worked very well with my Echo and was the perfect size for one.  About a month ago I noticed it wasn't heating like normal.  Food would take twice ever three times longer to warm up.  Then I noticed that even after only a minute the microwave would have steam seeping out of it.Then the smell.I noticed today that there was MOLD growing in the microwave!  I always cover my food and wipe down my microwave.  I have NEVER had a microwave that grew mold.I came on here to contact customer service and saw that even though I haven't even had it for a year, it's already out of service date.  Now it's trash.Save yourself and pass on this potentially hazardous microwave.

  A terrific 700w microwave (not high powered, but enough to do the job) that I purchased on June 2020 (8 months ago) and started sparking today. The Alexa integration was good, and for a low power microwave oven, it did what I needed to. Alas the product support ran out after six months. I was hoping it would last for at least a year, but it is what it is, a very inexpensive oven.

  I purchased the microwave on Woot as a refurbished unit.  I was wanting a small inexpensive microwave for work and this was less expensive than anything at Walmart  I do have an Alexa device in my office for music but never considered that connecting a microwave would worthwhile.But I was wrong!  If you are in a rush, telling Alexa to start and set the microwave is way faster.  Additionally, if the power goes off, as an Internet-connected device, it resets the time rather than flashing at you.  If it ever dies, and I had to replace it at full price, I would.As for the microwave itself, it is a nice compact, well-made unit and seems to work very well.

  This could be a nice little microwave, its quiet, and does an ok job for a 700watt microwave.  To me, the unforgivable flaw was that the glass carousel/turntable will just not stay attached to the drive coupler that makes it spin.  The slighted bump it, or if you slide a dish in/out rather than sitting it down directly in the center would cause the carousel to unattached from the coupler. Also, putting something (as light as a bag of popcorn) in this microwave off-center so it bumps one of the microwave sidewalls during cooking would also cause the carousel to become detached from the coupler that makes it spin. Not sure if mine was just defective or if that is the way they all are but I couldn't stand fighting it and returned it.

  One of the smallest 700 watt I could find, works fine, easy to use.  We use the Alexa feature occasionally, mostly for entertainment purposes.  You can't put something in the microwave more than 10 minutes before you ask Alexa to turn it on.  So if you are thinking of putting the leftovers in the microwave, settling into your chair for half an hour and then just telling her to turn it on, forget it.  On the other hand, the first thing I cooked in it were two sweet potatoes.  I told Alexa to cook 2 sweet potatoes.  She announced it would take 12 minutes and 23 seconds and it did and they were perfect, no turning, no checking, etc.

  This microwave was great for a first time apartment, but it did not last long after about a year of use. Microwaving a meal for more than a few minutes causes the microwave to “sweat” and you have to use several paper towels to clean it out. As this keeps happening, the base of the microwave under the plate starts to peel.

  Got this microwave during prime day deals. Which our microwave had taken a turn and it was a much bigger microwave. It came in about 2 days and yes it is small. However easily overcome by adjusting what plates and dishes I put in the microwave. The Alexa integration is cool and can be useful especially when I am busy on other tasks, however I still find myself also using the buttons which work just as good. The microwave albeit small will fit a normal human sized dinner plate so just don't try to cook thanks giving on a platter in it and think ahead on what dishes to use to microwave and you'll be ok. Fits full sized bag of popcorn with ease and the auto buy for popcorn is a must because my wife loves the stuff.

  This is a smaller microwave and only 700 watts of power. But it is perfect for reheating drinks and making single person meals or snacks. The build quality seems good and I have had no problems setting it up and using it with Alexa. My only complaint is that the power cord is too short. You will have to use an extension cord or a power strip if you plan to use it anyplace not close to a plug. For example, I have mine in my home office on top of a mini fridge like you would use in a dorm room and my fridge can reach the plug but the microwave could not. Not a big deal I just plugged both into a power strip but that is the only fault I have found with it so far. Now, if I could only get it to work when I say, "" Computer, Tea, Earl Grey, Hot.""

  I have to say this review would be much more negative if it weren't for the great price Amazon is offering this for especially for me during the times in which I bought this.  It took a bit of getting used (and I still struggle) to this microwave only being 700w (conventional microwaves are 1000w) and im always having to restart whatever im cooking BC it didn't Cook all the way even when going by the time  the instructions say to Cook for.  This is deff not an appliance for the impatient. This if you ask me, is rather ironic considering the greatest feature/convince about a microwave is the speed.  They are supposed to make cooking things quick and easy... I've come to accept this one is just an under achiever. And although  some times this is more annoying then others, nothing is as annoying as how many times I have to A. re setup the WiFi connection on this thing.OrB. The fact that the Alexa control / remote start feature will not work if the door has timed out!!!  Making it pointless unless your just wanting that feature so u don't have to touch the buttons again.But if you're looking to preload say some popcorn(as it is heavily advertised all over this thing) so that you can tell alexa to start cooking it later on when you finally cleared your way through traffic and are 5 mins away from being home from working all day and would love a hot fresh bag of popcorn ready for you... You can't.I don't know how long it gives you but u can't start it until you have opened and closed the door (lame)And for some reason and with absolutely no changes made to the WiFi network or to Alexa the WiFi will stop on the device and it won't be connected. The only east to fix this is to factory reset the device (pressing the 7 & 9 keys) then to set up the WiFi like when you first bought it by pressing the 2 button and configuring it in the Alexa app.  Not my idea of quick and easy.  BUT HELL what am I complaining it's only 50$ which I was allowed to pay over a 3 month period and it's just the right size for the tiny space I have above my stove.  Yay!!

  This microwave has the hardest time heating up anything. Whether it be asparagus or a potato, it takes twice as long as any other microwave I have ever owned. I have also never had a microwave build up a huge amount of condensation inside after heating something up oh, so much that I have to use a rag to draw out all the moisture.

  This microwave is perfect for a single person like me. It will handle any food preparation I need. It seems to me that it cooks quite fast, evenly, and thoroughly for its wattage. It works perfectly with Alexa, and I like that I can start and/or stop it while sitting at the table, or from another room. The presets are great (but no pizza preset?!? No matter, “Alexa high for 30 second “ does it). If there is one negative, it would be that the display is rather dim in bright light, but not so much that it can’t be read, or so much that I would drop a star in the rating.

  Pretty disappointed. When we plugged it in it sparked and now it doesn’t work. Never even got a chance to use it! It also ruined the inversion our semi truck (1800 watt inverter, so that’s not the problem). Now we have to get another microwave AND a new inverter. Not happy!!!Edit: an Amazon rep contacted us and after answering a few questions and providing photos, replaced the microwave. The new one is great! No problems and works very well!

  I've owned my Galanz microwave for a couple of months now and have been happy with it.  It looks great and works well. It has an average amount of power of it's class. The dial time setting plus the 30 second tap is a good combination, but sometimes the tap results in nothing.  I like that the lights can be turned off for power savings.

  I’m not sure what people are expecting or how they use them anymore, but I can see no issue with my microwave. Although I have a few amazon devices in my home, I don’t have echo. Yet I found even without it for this price the microwave works very well. I made to flawless bags of popcorn as soon as I pulled it out, &  I’ve been reheated as usual.  I use my microwave for popcorn & to reheat food only. I don’t use it to cook because I’ve had expensive microwaves that don’t cook food well. The simple fact is they shouldn’t be used for real cooking. If & when they are, no matter the price the food will never be actually good.Even knowing I will never allow an echo in my home this microwave is a great deal for the price. & it works perfectly for my family’s needs

  Received this as a Christmas gift and couldn't be happier with it.  I'm a little OCD about fingerprints all over our appliances so I love the fact this integrates with Alexa so we can just tell her how long without having to use the keypad.  We are really deep into the Alexa ecosystem so this is yet another great addition to that.  It's just my wife and I so the size is perfect for us.  Our old one was of similar size so the extra time needed compared to higher wattages was irrelevant to us.  Hope they do come out with a larger size though for the folks that need a more ""family"" sized one.

  We needed a small unit to fit a cabinet in the dining room. The main reason I bought it was because I had a gift card.

  It took a while for me to realize that I hate this microwave. I do not recommend it at all. A waste of money.. First of all the minor issue: Alexa. Half the time it won't listen to Alexa commands because it says the ""door isn't shut"".Now the main issues: it takes forever to cook anything. My old microwave could cook stuff in half the time. It takes forever and cooks very a evenly.Lastly, honestly my biggest issue with this is the moister/steam.  No matter what I cook steam comes out of the side vent of the microwave....so much that there is always a constant puddle in the bottom of the microwave. I can cook something for 1 min or 5 min and I will still get a puddle in the bottom.  I feel like it is going to light on fire at any minute. Another minor issue is how small it is. Can't hold a full size dinner plate. It's the most disappointing thing I have gotten from amazon.

  Speaking to a device and telling it to cook food for you reminds me of ""Star Trek"". This tech still has a long way to go before it matches that standard, but it's still cool.Pros:- It's really convenient to put something in the microwave after the preparation process got your hands slightly messy, push the door closed with your elbow, and speak to start it instead of getting the keypad messy, then forgetting about it and having a bigger mess later.- I love the convenience of Alexa knowing the right times to cook things. I tell her what I have, she asks how much, and we go!- Did I mention that this thing is amazingly convenient? I don't wanna forget that part.Cons:- The power of 700W is lower than most these days. It's significantly lower than the wattage used in the instructions for almost all recipes. A few recipes even tell you not to use a microwave below 1,000W. In my experience, foods with that warning come out all right with some extra time; YMMV. Which leads me to...- She hasn't learned about all foods yet. In fact, she hasn't learned about very many at all. Like I said, a long way to go. As a practical matter, that means it can be difficult to convert cooking times accurately.- The mobile app pairs one Echo device in your home with the microwave. Presumably, that means only that device can control the microwave. Actually, ALL Echo devices in the home can control it--including devices never before paired and devices explicitly unpaired (in my home, anyway).Overall, good product. Lives up to my expectation of Amazon quality. And you have to know this thing is WAAAAAYYYYY convenient!!

  This is a great microwave with great features. 700W is it's only disadvantage. I would give it 5 stars if it were slightly more powerful at even 800W. I've come across microwave instructions that state ""For microwave ovens less than 800 watts please use stove top instructions.""  If you only use it to reheat leftovers or make popcorn or most frozen microwave meals, this microwave can't be beat (you'll just need to add more time and the 30 seconds button comes in handy).

  The device came already attached to my account.  I plugged it in and my Alexa App said the Microwave was found.  I opened the app and tried to setup the Alexa button with a Echo device in line of sight (shouldn't matter since it is all done through the internet anyway) 15 ft away.  It failed.  I tried over and over and it just fails.  I tried asking the Echo devices to control the microwave.  They failed too.  I removed it from my account and re-added it.  It got the wireless setup fine and joined back on my account.  The wireless symbol was lit up like before and still failed.  I powercycled the microwave and the wireless symbol shows up for about 5 minutes and then turns off.  During that five minutes still nothing works.  Every once in a while the wireless symbol shows back up but it still does not work.  I have about 16 echo devices throughout my house and they work fine.  The Microwave communicates to Amazon just fine as the app knows it is there.  Just doesn't work.Overall it is a small, pretty weak microwave minus the Alexa integration, which doesn't work for me.

  It’s not rocket science. This microwave is NOT your family microwave. It’s for a small apartment or dorm. If your a college student, this is PERFECT for you! It’s a decent microwave. My only issue is that it slightly burns my popcorn. However, I would call that user error since I put in popcorn that I know is too big for the microwave since it’s so small. I haven’t had an issue with defrosting my frozen meals, reheating coffee or even making some soup. I would recommend this to a college freshman if they are looking for a good microwave for their dorm. Or I would also send this to friends who is looking for a small microwave to put in their small kitchen. Would I recommend this to a family or anyone living in a home? Personally I would not. The microwave is too compact for those with families and homes. Y’all need a big microwave, no need to live so compact like a college student. As a result I find that this products receives unfair reviews because I think this products is marketed towards the wrong group of people. It’s a wonderful microwave, I just think it suits people better than others. Also, the Alexa feature is super cool.

  I love this little microwave. I was using a much larger one but now I have a lot more counter space for prepping food.

  Fun that it integrates with Alexa/Echo, but that’s about the only attraction.  700w is really underpowered for a microwave.  Most frozen food and other recommendations are based on a 1000w or 1100w microwave so you end up having to add 30-40% more time for everything.  Having a rating “for small spaces” is a non-sequitur - a more powerful microwave is just as good for small spaces as this less powerful one.  Unless you live in an 18th century farmhouse with old circuits that might give out under a stronger load, probably best to get another unit or wait until Amazon makes a more standard-powered unit.

  I read some reviews about how hot the microwave gets. This is a 700w microwave not meant for roasts or whole chicken. I suggest you use it at #10 full power about 15min. Max. Then for longer times drop the level to #8. This allows the microwave to cool during operation and can be used for extremely long cooking periods.

I used it w/out Alexa and like any other microwave, it worked fine. Today, I finally set the device to Alexa. Step by step instructions on the Alexa app was an easy process.  Now, the clock works, all is connected and I ask... Alexa, turn on the microwave for 2 two minutes... and like magic, it turns on without a push of a button. I reheated a breakfast sandwich for 30 seconds and it was piping hot. I used it several times today and every time wonder, why the one star reviews? Amazon, has amazing customer service. They seem to be the only ones left that listen and want to satisfy their customer's needs. Rather than give a perfectly good product a bad review, why not call? Customers may have received a defective product. Like people, not all of them are bad, and I'm pretty sure, Amazon, would make it right. They always have for me.Just like my apartment, this microwave is small, as mentioned in the description. It's perfect for one plate.All in all, set up was an easy process, the food comes out hot, it fits in tight spaces and Alexa does the work.Now, we just need Alexa to grow arms and legs and be more like Rosie on, The Jetsons.

  I want to start by saying this is good SMALL microwave, but finally caused an issue that I had been worrying about after reading other reviews. Even after following Amazons owns guidelines about using a 2.75oz or smaller size bag of popcorn, the bag is too big when it puffs up fully. If you aren’t keeping an eye on it the bag will snag on the walls or top, and it will stop spinning. When that happens, make sure you have a fire extinguisher on hand in case it starts a fire. Tonight I had a bag of popcorn start smoking, and similar to another review, it was burning on this small panel inside the microwave that you can see in the pictures. It’s cool that you can talk to Alexa and it’ll start the microwave, and it fits an average size plate perfectly fine, thaws well, but this is a fire hazard when it comes to making popcorn (even if you follow Amazons own recommendation) because it’s so small. Save some money up and put it towards a larger microwave. You can live without the Alexa function in exchange for your home safety.

  It is perfect!  I just got it today and just took it out of the box plugged it in and and did the rest on the app.  No more clock settings and trying to figure out what time I should set things for.  Just ask the echo dot and it gives me the answers I need and I just tell the microwave and wala it starts running. So if my hands are full or Im busy and need more time on the microwave I just tell it.  So handy when you have teenagers.

  It's a neat small microwave that fits in a small place. The only problem so far is the turn table like glass plate. It rests on a round ring with wheels.

  This microwave is your average or dorm room size microwave.  We pre-ordered this microwave and have been using it since it was delivered on November 14th. You have to connect it to a Echo device whether it's the Show, Dot, or Spot.  Once connected to a Echo device there are several commands you can use.  I honestly was on the fence, but when our microwave was going out I decided to give this a try.  So far so good.  It heats up pretty well. No need to keep warming things up.  You can even tell it what you are cooking and it will have a set time for it as well as heat level. I say give it a try!

  You ready for this?? It’s... basically a normal microwave. Which is perfect, it’s exactly what we wanted.Though the Alexa connection is fun & super useful. Just make sure you’re Echo device is within listening range of you when you’re at the microwave. Otherwise it’ll have a hard time hearing you & eventually not be worth it. There’s also a learning curve, but if you put in the time to learn some of the features, then it’s worth it.It gets 4 stars because set-up took us nearly an hour. Troubleshooting didn’t help much. Eventually, we determined it wasn’t registering easily because it’s far from our weak & dinky router & you need wi-fi for the set-up/connection.

  This microwave stopped heating up food after two months. I tried to get a refund, but the return window had closed, so they are sending me a replacement. Fingers crossed that this new one works for more than 2 months. I could have gotten a refund, but they wanted to charge a $12 restocking fee. No way -- I refuse to pay that for  a non-working microwave. I started out trying to get the return or refund via chat, but after explaining in detail how exactly the microwave was not working and what I had tried to get it to work, finally the chat person said that she was ready to issue my refund, but because it is an Amazon Basic product, I had to call in.

  Had to reset when moving, which was frustrating but ok I guess. Chief concern is it does not know how to cook many things, or telling it how to cook them is not intuitive.

  We bought a used microwave from Goodwill for $10 when we moved cross-country 11 years ago. After nearly 10 years of use, we decided to buy a new one just because. The size of this one was perfect and the price was right ($59 at the time). At first, it was fine. Never set up Alexa because there was no point. After about 15 months, it started making a sparking sound sometimes when making microwave popcorn. Then it started flashing and sparking on almost everything. We never put metal or non-safe dishes in it, it just stopped working as expected. Sometimes, it would still heat up a cup of coffee, but finally just had to replace it.

  I bought this 7 months ago. I had no issues until now. I went to heat up cold coffee and it started to arc inside. Immediately, I stopped it. This was a cup I have used several times and is microwave safe. Empty it would arc. I cleaned it well in case a speck of metal was there I could not see and still would arc inside.I am outside my return window so I can’t comment on customer service.

  We bought this in March of 2020. We very rarely use the microwave, maybe a couple of times per week. Today, it died. It made a strange beep and continued cooking but the food was cold, no dice. It never really did a good job at heating our food to begin with. I always had to add at least 30 seconds up to 1 minute beyond what the instructions would say, and yes, I was looking at the lower wattage options. This microwave is a POS and I would NOT recommend it.

  I was sad moving into my new apartment and realizing it didn't come with a microwave.  The counterspace  in the kitchen isn't very tall from counter to under cabinet, so I needed to get a small enough one to fit that space.  Saw this one had Alexa and pulled the trigger.

  I'm not sure what the expectation is for the life of a microwave but less than a year is not okay in my opinion. We pre-ordered this as soon as it was available as we love all our Alexa devices and use them constantly. The microwave is small but meets our needs perfectly. About a month ago we noticed it was very slow to warm things and today it took two and a half minutes to warm up half a cup of lukewarm coffee on full power.

  I've had this microwave since this past August.  Up until now I loved it.  Easy to use, especially with any Echo device on my network.However, a couple of days ago it started arcing.  Anyone who's put metal in a microwave knows the sound and the associated sparks.  I never put metal in it, though.  It seems to be arcing from behind the panel on the right side.  The burned spot can be seen in the picture.Needless to say, I've had to stop using it.  Haven't yet decided to look into the warranty, wondering if it's worth paying shipping to send it back if it's covered.

  I figured out how to set the clock manually! Leave plugged in for a while (5 -10min?)until you hear a ( it will say ""fail""), press pause/stop (the clock should say 12:00 or 00:00. i can't remember). If it's 12:00 just set the time from there. If not hold down the ""5"" button until it beeps, set the time, press ""start"" to lock in  the time you set. Hope this works for you!

  Love the Alexa aspect of this microwave! So cool and she actually works well with it. The microwave itself is great, easier to use with Alexa rather than manually actually. The door is easy to open and close. The only issue I have is that it didnt have a larger size option :( so if you want the cool Alexa controlled appliance you gotta go small. My kitchen is tiny but my dinner plates don't fit! Other than that its an awesome idea! Loving it.

It is lower power than my other MW so I have to adjust my thinking accordingly.  I still like it...especially today (Thanksgiving), but wouldn't want it as my only microwave.

  This microwave is so cool and the Alexa integration is awesome but the microwave itself sucks. I am not sure if its just my microwave but it doesn't heat consistently.

  I am not a lazy person by nature, but it is fun to have Alexa turn the microwave on with voice commands. This is a 700w microwave, so everything takes longer to cook than bigger units, but we just adjust the cook time. It fits better in the space we have, with a smaller profile. Controls are easy once you figure it out (assuming you want to manually operate it without Alexa). It doesn't have a bunch of bell-and-whistles we don't need. We're happy so far.

  Smaller than I'd like, but it works well enough for my purposes. Just be mindful of what you cook in it; I was making a regular-sized bag of popcorn that I guess was too big for the unit. The bag got caught on the metal plate on the inside right of the microwave and lit on fire. No damage to the microwave but now I'm very careful about anything brushing up and getting stuck against the inside of it. Ruined my bag of popcorn :(

  I have been using this for just over two (2) years (bought in September of 2018) without any issues, other than about once every 6 weeks needing to unplug it and plug it back in for it to sync back up with my Echo devices. However, this morning (January 1, 2021), that all changed. On the first use, after about 2 seconds of running, sparks started flying and smoke occurred. Luckily, I was still close enough to it to turn it off manually as soon as it happened. The picture shows the result.This seems to be an issue that I am not alone with. Not sure if this has been rectified on newer models or not, but something to keep in mind.If I hadn't been right there to turn it off, it could have been a very bad start to the new year.

  This unit works great in every respect. Using Alexa is very easy and convenient as an addition to normal button presses that you can also use if you want. I haven't yet tested the presets for defrosting various foods, like heating up coffee, making popcorn, etc but the manual says the settings for these are adjustable so if the presets aren't quite to your taste it may take a few trials to get it just right. One minor complaint is that this unit replaced an older 0.7cu ft unit that I have had for years, and the interior of the Amazon unit is definitely smaller. Not sure why this is, but it is.

  Microwave is compact, seems durable and has great integration with Alexa, making it easy to use if both of your hands are busy cooking. The functionality, however, leaves something to be desired. The microwave, at first, would constantly overheat. I tried to relocate the microwave to see if things would change, they didn't. Recently the microwave gains a lot of condensation on the inside, which if left over night, formed mold. I keep a clean household, however, do not find it convenient to wipe down the microwave or leave door open to dry out after each use.

  If you’re looking for the next smart product to add to your home here it is. And why although absolutely unnecessary, ask why not. You might think “oh I’ll leave a bag of popcorn in there for whenever and tell her to cook it.” Unfortunately the door has to have been opened and closed within a certain amount of time to have Alexa microwave for you. So in reality you have to be by the microwave anyways so why not just hit the button? Again, cause why not. The price is no different really than any other microwave this size. And it does work well and heats pretty evenly. This microwave is the newest item of opulence for your home with minimal actual application for the addition of Alexa to it.

  I've had this Microwave since the day it was released, I pre-ordered it. It does the job, and it's not really more expensive than other Microwaves of the size. The Alexa stuff is more novelty than useful, and I've probably only used it two or three times for anything. As a microwave it does a decent job, it's a bit on the small side but works fine compared to other microwaves of the same size and wattage.

  Well, I purchased this because of the size. Loved that it connected to Alexa. Only my husband and myself in the household and we are barely home. So how much use has it really gotten? One day before the year anniversary of purchasing this I attempted to reheat a bowl of food and it started making a sputtering and cracking sound and then smoke started pouring out of it. I opened the door and on the right side, inside the unit, there was a scorch mark. I quickly unplugged it and took it outside. I chatted with a Amazon representative and was told it was no longer guaranteed. Hmmm? Still, should it have caught on fire?

  The voice dictation is really convenient and works well. Cheap and does the job.A couple obvious features are missing:""Microwave for one minute thirty seconds"" works, while ""microwave for a minute and a half"" does not.Alexa doesn't know how to calculate microwave time for some common tasks like melting butter.Having to know the mass of the item you are microwaving is difficult sometimes. I have no clue how much my two slices of pizza weigh. Automatic mass measurement would be a 5 star feature.And then this microwave is small! It barely fits one of my dinner plates, and a bag of popcorn can't fully rotate inside of it. Popcorn bags come out somewhat burned in places because they can't rotate :(

  The microwave worked fairly well for the first nine months of owning it. However, recently after microwaving a bag of popcorn, the inside of the microwave starting sparking, making loud zapping/buzzing sounds, and I could see some sort of line of electricity bouncing around. I immediately stopped the microwave, and a strong burnt odor came out. I heard that sometimes this can happen if the inside of the microwave is dirty, so I gave it a deep and thorough cleaning and tried again. Now, every time it turns on, it does the same thing after about 5 or 10 seconds. I would say that the microwave is pretty cheap, and now we have to get a new one after only nine months of owning it.

  I recently purchased a 1.4 cu foot microwave and it took up almost all of my countertop space. I replaced it with this little beauty end have no regrets.  I can still fit the same plates and high bowls used in my older, larger microwave in this microwave.  I wasn’t certain how often I would use it with Alexa but use it constantly.

  The microwave works well enough. It's on the small side, which is clearly described. The issue is that it doesn't work without an Alexa device to set it up. I purchased this when I moved into a new house and hadn't unpacked my echo yet, so I wasn't able to set it up right away. When I finally unearthed my Echo I had to spend about 20 minutes setting it up, and the Alexa integration still doesn't feel intuitive. If you don't have the time to read all of the directions and want a microwave you can just plug in and use, this is not the microwave for you.

  This microwave is good for what it is. A cheap microwave. It works great but has a few issues.  Since its power isn't as high as your average microwave it requires more time to heat things up. It doesn't seem to have a good way to really vent which makes it act kind of like a steamer. After heating something sometimes the walls will be covered in water even if you cover whatever it is you make. Other than having to whip it down it works fine.

  This is a great little microwave that's easy to set up and use.  Either ask Alexa to microwave something, or use the buttons like an old fashioned microwave.

  Hello, this is the tail of my my short story with my new microwave Alexa or as I tend to call her the vixen I eat with.  You can see Alexa with her tail sticking up in the small cubby hole I have assigned her to inhabit. It's the only space available and she fits tightly, which is a good thing for a cook.  Directions from her previous owner Amazon were very adequate and the most involved part was downloading her software.  Like most ladies she's taking a bit of getting used too. I ask her to pop some corn for me the first night, our honeymoon of sorts.  She glared at me with her cool, blue winking eyeball saying, ""Oh! I suppose  you'll be wanting me to walk it over to you and help butter it too."".  Anyway, I like her shinny exterior finish, the way she says, ""What?

  Bought this as a Christmas gift for my elderly mother. She had been wanting a microwave after 3 years without one. She loves her echo so we decided on this one for the alexa integration. Turns out it was just a gimmick that didn't really work that well.She has maybe used it about 2 dozen times since last christmas only for it to catch on fire on her last night.I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. She is hard of hearing and had she walked out of the room for a minute it could have been a catastrophe.Seems that many people are reporting fires. A refund would be the least amazon could do.

  This microwave was small, which I was looking for, and a good price, but it takes forever to re-heat anything, and then not very evenly. I know, however, that that is to be expected of small microwaves. The real probelm is that we bought it at the end of August, and in the past 2 weeks it zaps and burns, as if there's metal inside, when we're only using plastic tupperware dishes and plates we've used many times before. It doesn't happen all the time, but is now happening more and more frequently, to the point where we no longer feel safe using it.

  This product is small with the same capacity of the one replaced. It is also less noisy both audibly and in radiating microwave rf noise. Alexa is cool but more response is necessary. Alexa should remind you if you forget to open door after heating. There should be more spoken commands that represent preprogrammed events. These options may exist or can be programmed but I don’t see it. Coffee heating originally responded to 1:15 for new coffee  “heat one cup of coffee” but it changed to “reheat one cup of coffee” for the same 1:15 seconds. Heat one cup of coffee became :37.

  My wife and I first received this microwave in early April 2020. The first thing sign that something was unusual was that it never connected to any of our Echo devices. It tried its best - and claimed it was connected - but voice controls didn't work, we always got a response about needing a smart appliance. We shrugged it off - the price was right, and we needed the microwave, so we just used it as a normal one.Fast forward 6 months. I was making a bag of popcorn, the same kind I always make (at least once a week) and about two minutes into the 3:15 cook, the glass rotating plate shattered. The popcorn bag was fine, no burn marks anywhere.Would not recommend unless you want a microwave that MIGHT talk to Alexa, and don't mind replacing every six months.

  I thought this was a good idea but now I’m afraid of this microwave.1) More than 3 minutes of cooking leads to dripping condensation buildup all over the inside and wet food.2) The rotating food plate falls off the ring all the time and has to be repositioned so it will turn.3) It’s so small some plates don’t fit so reheating leftovers is difficult.4) it gets so hot quickly it stops cooking with just a fan on and now it’s making this weird electrical popping sound like it’s going to burst into flames.Taking it to the electronic recycling center.

  The microwave works good, just for some reason was expecting something a little larger. If I place a paper towel on top of something it always falls off because there isn't sufficient room for it to spin. But my main reason for 3 stars is there aren't alot of useful commands to give it. They should have crowd sourced times for different food amounts with some math maybe to compute other times and more crowd sourcing to confirm those algorithms and timings. Just what I expected but while alexa hears and responds quickly it's probably because it's so barebones.

  I don't really understand the use for a microwave to be smart although I imagine it would be very useful to a person who is visually impaired. However fortunately I am not. I bought it because it was one of the cheapest options and I don't use microwaves a lot. That being said, I have owned LGs and a Magic Chef microwave before this one. It doesn't even come close to the high quality of those. Yes, the wattage is less (700 compare to my previous ones that were 1100 watts) but this one is also louder, also the beeps are annoyingly loud and there is a disturbing buzzing sound when it heats something up.

Easy to set up and doesn't take up too much space. Heats reasonably quickly considering the size and wattage.

  Excellent addition to the household, how often I throw something in and walk away asking it to go is really convenient. If you cook and also need to reheat some stuff while making other stuff it's handy. If you already have a good microwave then maybe don't worry about this one until you need to replace it. I was in a position where I needed a new one and thought of this one for the convenience of Alexa integration.

  I think the wattage is the same as my last microwave, but it seems like this microwave takes a little longer to cook. I am not 100% sure on the wattage of my previous microwave. So, the issue may be the last microwave had a higher wattage and not an actual issue with the microwave itself. I would definitely recommend to if you are looking for a smart small microwave.

  I had this microwave for less than a year and it started sparking when I was heating butter this past week.  No suggestions online on how to replace the waveguide, but doesn't seem that I should be having these issues after so little use.  There has to be a generic one I can buy on Amazon, but not something I'm familiar with.  The Alexa integration works about 80% of the time, but the other 20% says that it is not responding.  I would not recommend this to anyone, even for the money.

I don't care about the Alexa integration so my review is solely based on how microwave functions.I don't really mind the small size, it's perfect for the size of my kitchen counter. The microwave does not heat up things like I'm used to. If the package says 2 minutes, you're putting it in there for 3 mins+I microwaved a Trader Joe's lasagna and it said 10-12 mins.

It did not rust inside, but afraid the shielding might now be damaged.Used it mostly for warming things up and defrosting, so gentle use. Save your money and buy a better quality appliance.Alexa feature was fun for a couple weeks but then, never bothered to use it.

  Was fun using voice commands for awhile with the Alexa, then popping popcorn it blew out a circuit in my house. Got the electrician to replace the breaker, moved the Microwave to another room. Microwaving popcorn and it started sparking and catching fire. Microwave is only 6 months old, has a 1 year warranty, but searching Google and spending about an hour searching the Amazon website makes it impossible to navigate to get info on a warranty return outside of 30 days.

  The microwave is so small that when you put popcorn in,  it will not even allow it to spin because the popcorn bag is too big for the super small space. You can't put a large coffee drink from Starbucks in it to reheat it either, the height is too short.

  This microwave was the best thing since sliced bread for the first couple months. However as time progressed the microwave would only rotate intermittently. So I figured it was a glitch.  I would open the door and close it and it would rotate. However one year after buying this microwave it blew up. This is not a safe product I have children in my home and this was a life saver at first but had one of my children been operating this device when it decided to clunk out this would be a different review.

  The microwave itself works decently. I do wish Amazon offered something more powerful than a 700W model, but it does cook relatively quietly and reliably.However, the Alexa app is pretty useless when it comes to this microwave, unfortunately. All I can do from the app is order popcorn. I would have expected to be able to pause or turn on the microwave remotely, or perhaps be notified when it was done cooking, but none of those things are currently possible.One thing I don't like seeing is the internal circuitry being exposed through the holes where the door latches into the main body. That doesn't look great but I suppose it works.So I'd say it's a decent if underpowered microwave with smart features that probably require an Echo device that I'm not really motivated to buy after this.

  Some reviews question the wisdom of integrating Alexa in this product. After all, they say, placing food inside is hands on activity, and the keyboard is thus right at hand for entering microwaving parameters. In my experience I've come to disagree. While I'm placing food in my microwave I'm also issuing my verbal instructions via Alexa as I close the door. I believe this saves me several seconds each time.

  Have been using this microwave for a few months now, very simple, sleek, and easy to setup. I debated buying this for some time due to the fact it is quite small. (I ended up getting this as a gift and would have been pleased with this if I had purchased this myself) The ask Alexa feature works well and we enjoy using the voice control but isn’t a big life changer. When factoring in that amazon built a microwave, it is definitely worth the price if you are simply looking for an affordable microwave and/or another fun function to add to your smart home collection.

  It’s a tiny microwave. But good enough as long as the biggest thing you’re gonna microwave is a bag of popcorn. A little glitchy at times and trying to set it up the first time was a pain as the Alexa app could not find the new device.

  If you already have other Alexa devices hooked up to your wifi through the app then adding this microwave is as easy as plugging it in then go into app and choose which device you want to use (ie dot,show etc) and thats it. I am loving not having to push buttons anymore and cooks very good. If it is solid it helps to know the ounces and if liquid tell it how many cups (it has alot of presets). Still limited now but it will get smarter over time as all their products do hence the 4 stars but it was good out of the gate. And as added bonus you can use it like a regular microwave with all the same features you get with any microwave and tge price is pretty comparible if not cheaper than other microwaves.

  I purchased this microwave in December 2018. We are Alexa integrated so I was excited to get this, but now, a little over a year later, the side panel is smoking when we use it. I’m afraid to use it any more, so I guess I will purchase a different microwave oven. Which is sad because I loved the Alexa integration.

There was literally a puddle left on the microwave plate and I was worried about the steam getting into the electronics because of the amount that came out when I opened the door 2 minutes after it finished cooking.

  This microwave did microwave things just fine, however, it never connected up with my Alexa home system despite trying many different units.  Today after only a few months of use, a loud popping noise and bright flash came from inside while microwaving some popcorn.  It's past it's warrantee date, so I'm out of luck.

  I have used this Microwave maybe 5 times? It seems to keep moisture after each use so I have to leave it open to ""dry"", and I used it today and it no longer heats. The power level is on 10, set it for 3 minutes, and started up fine, sounds like it's working, only for the 3 minutes to end and the food is still completely cold. It does work with Alexa!

  We needed a more compact microwave for our kitchen and this model ""fit"" our limited countertop perfectly.  The power wattage is much less than our full-sized unit but we simply doubled the cook times to get the results.  The Alexa integration was simple. We have an Echo Dot and this microwave synced as soon as we powered up. We use both the Alexa commands and the ""manual"" features.  This is a good unit for small spaces and lighter microwave uses.

  Voice functionality needs work. If you say microwave  this food at this weight it often doesn't have values for it. Most of its voice functionality is just for simple things you could punch in. If you say for instance defrost this food at this weight it will say for how long. I bought it thinking it would be a little smarter.  I got it on sale so it was a good price for the value.  It's nice that you can stop the device remotely.

  I’ve had the microwave for just over a month, it’s lower power than some that I’ve had in the past which is fine. However we tried to make popcorn in it yesterday (standard bag) and it was so small that the bag kept getting stuck and started to burn without even popping anything. Not great.
